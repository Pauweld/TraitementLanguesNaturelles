a
scandal
in
bohemia
i
she
is
always
the
woman
i
have
seldom
heard
him
mention
her
under
any
other
name
his
eyes
she
eclipses
and
predominates
the
whole
of
her
sex
was
not
that
he
felt
any
emotion
akin
to
love
for
emotions
and
that
one
particularly
were
abhorrent
to
his
cold
precise
but
admirably
balanced
mind
was
i
take
it
the
most
perfect
reasoning
and
observing
machine
that
the
world
has
seen
but
as
a
lover
he
would
have
placed
himself
in
a
false
position
never
spoke
of
the
softer
passions
save
with
a
gibe
and
a
sneer
were
admirable
things
for
the
observer
excellent
for
drawing
the
veil
from
men
s
motives
and
actions
for
the
trained
reasoner
to
admit
such
intrusions
into
his
own
delicate
and
finely
adjusted
temperament
was
to
introduce
a
distracting
factor
which
might
throw
a
doubt
upon
all
his
mental
results
in
a
sensitive
instrument
or
a
crack
in
one
of
his
own
high
power
lenses
would
not
be
more
disturbing
than
a
strong
emotion
in
a
nature
such
as
his
yet
there
was
but
one
woman
to
him
and
that
woman
was
the
late
of
dubious
and
questionable
memory
i
had
seen
little
of
lately
marriage
had
drifted
us
away
from
each
other
own
complete
happiness
and
the
home
centred
interests
which
rise
up
around
the
man
who
first
finds
himself
master
of
his
own
establishment
were
sufficient
to
absorb
all
my
attention
while
who
loathed
every
form
of
society
with
his
whole
soul
remained
in
our
lodgings
in
buried
among
his
old
books
and
alternating
from
week
to
week
between
cocaine
and
ambition
the
drowsiness
of
the
drug
and
the
fierce
energy
of
his
own
keen
nature
was
still
as
ever
deeply
attracted
by
the
study
of
crime
and
occupied
his
immense
faculties
and
extraordinary
powers
of
observation
in
following
out
those
clues
and
clearing
up
those
mysteries
which
had
been
abandoned
as
hopeless
by
the
official
police
time
to
time
i
heard
some
vague
account
of
his
doings
of
his
summons
to
in
the
case
of
the
murder
of
his
clearing
up
of
the
singular
tragedy
of
the
brothers
at
and
finally
of
the
mission
which
he
had
accomplished
so
delicately
and
successfully
for
the
reigning
family
of
these
signs
of
his
activity
however
which
i
merely
shared
with
all
the
readers
of
the
daily
press
i
knew
little
of
my
former
friend
and
companion
night
it
was
on
the
twentieth
of
i
was
returning
from
a
journey
to
a
patient
for
i
had
now
returned
to
civil
practice
when
my
way
led
me
through
i
passed
the
well
remembered
door
which
must
always
be
associated
in
my
mind
with
my
wooing
and
with
the
dark
incidents
of
the
in
i
was
seized
with
a
keen
desire
to
see
again
and
to
know
how
he
was
employing
his
extraordinary
powers
rooms
were
brilliantly
lit
and
even
as
i
looked
up
i
saw
his
tall
spare
figure
pass
twice
in
a
dark
silhouette
against
the
blind
was
pacing
the
room
swiftly
eagerly
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
chest
and
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
me
who
knew
his
every
mood
and
habit
his
attitude
and
manner
told
their
own
story
was
at
work
again
had
risen
out
of
his
drug
created
dreams
and
was
hot
upon
the
scent
of
some
new
problem
i
rang
the
bell
and
was
shown
up
to
the
chamber
which
had
formerly
been
in
part
my
own
manner
was
not
effusive
seldom
was
but
he
was
glad
i
think
to
see
me
hardly
a
word
spoken
but
with
a
kindly
eye
he
waved
me
to
an
armchair
threw
across
his
case
of
cigars
and
indicated
a
spirit
case
and
a
gasogene
in
the
corner
he
stood
before
the
fire
and
looked
me
over
in
his
singular
introspective
fashion
suits
you
he
remarked
i
think
that
you
have
put
on
seven
and
a
half
pounds
since
i
saw
you
i
answered
i
should
have
thought
a
little
more
a
trifle
more
i
fancy
in
practice
again
i
observe
did
not
tell
me
that
you
intended
to
go
into
harness
how
do
you
know
i
see
it
i
deduce
it
do
i
know
that
you
have
been
getting
yourself
very
wet
lately
and
that
you
have
a
most
clumsy
and
careless
servant
girl
dear
said
i
this
is
too
much
would
certainly
have
been
burned
had
you
lived
a
few
centuries
ago
is
true
that
i
had
a
country
walk
on
and
came
home
in
a
dreadful
mess
but
as
i
have
changed
my
clothes
i
can
t
imagine
how
you
deduce
it
to
she
is
incorrigible
and
my
wife
has
given
her
notice
but
there
again
i
fail
to
see
how
you
work
it
out
chuckled
to
himself
and
rubbed
his
long
nervous
hands
together
is
simplicity
itself
said
he
my
eyes
tell
me
that
on
the
inside
of
your
left
shoe
just
where
the
firelight
strikes
it
the
leather
is
scored
by
six
almost
parallel
cuts
they
have
been
caused
by
someone
who
has
very
carelessly
scraped
round
the
edges
of
the
sole
in
order
to
remove
crusted
mud
from
it
you
see
my
double
deduction
that
you
had
been
out
in
vile
weather
and
that
you
had
a
particularly
malignant
boot
slitting
specimen
of
the
slavey
to
your
practice
if
a
gentleman
walks
into
my
rooms
smelling
of
iodoform
with
a
black
mark
of
nitrate
of
silver
upon
his
right
forefinger
and
a
bulge
on
the
right
side
of
his
top
hat
to
show
where
he
has
secreted
his
stethoscope
i
must
be
dull
indeed
if
i
do
not
pronounce
him
to
be
an
active
member
of
the
medical
profession
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
ease
with
which
he
explained
his
process
of
deduction
i
hear
you
give
your
reasons
i
remarked
the
thing
always
appears
to
me
to
be
so
ridiculously
simple
that
i
could
easily
do
it
myself
though
at
each
successive
instance
of
your
reasoning
i
am
baffled
until
you
explain
your
process
yet
i
believe
that
my
eyes
are
as
good
as
yours
so
he
answered
lighting
a
cigarette
and
throwing
himself
down
into
an
armchair
see
but
you
do
not
observe
distinction
is
clear
example
you
have
frequently
seen
the
steps
which
lead
up
from
the
hall
to
this
room
often
some
hundreds
of
times
how
many
are
there
many
i
don
t
know
so
have
not
observed
yet
you
have
seen
is
just
my
point
i
know
that
there
are
seventeen
steps
because
i
have
both
seen
and
observed
the
way
since
you
are
interested
in
these
little
problems
and
since
you
are
good
enough
to
chronicle
one
or
two
of
my
trifling
experiences
you
may
be
interested
in
this
threw
over
a
sheet
of
thick
pink
tinted
note
paper
which
had
been
lying
open
upon
the
table
came
by
the
last
post
said
he
it
aloud
note
was
undated
and
without
either
signature
or
address
will
call
upon
you
to
night
at
a
quarter
to
eight
o
clock
it
said
a
gentleman
who
desires
to
consult
you
upon
a
matter
of
the
very
deepest
moment
recent
services
to
one
of
the
royal
houses
of
have
shown
that
you
are
one
who
may
safely
be
trusted
with
matters
which
are
of
an
importance
which
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
account
of
you
we
have
from
all
quarters
received
in
your
chamber
then
at
that
hour
and
do
not
take
it
amiss
if
your
visitor
wear
a
mask
is
indeed
a
mystery
i
remarked
do
you
imagine
that
it
means
i
have
no
data
yet
is
a
capital
mistake
to
theorize
before
one
has
data
one
begins
to
twist
facts
to
suit
theories
instead
of
theories
to
suit
facts
the
note
itself
do
you
deduce
from
it
i
carefully
examined
the
writing
and
the
paper
upon
which
it
was
written
man
who
wrote
it
was
presumably
well
to
do
i
remarked
endeavouring
to
imitate
my
companion
s
processes
paper
could
not
be
bought
under
half
a
crown
a
packet
is
peculiarly
strong
and
stiff
that
is
the
very
word
said
is
not
an
paper
at
all
it
up
to
the
light
i
did
so
and
saw
a
large
e
with
a
small
g
a
p
and
a
large
g
with
a
small
t
woven
into
the
texture
of
the
paper
do
you
make
of
that
asked
name
of
the
maker
no
doubt
or
his
monogram
rather
at
all

the

heavy

his
shelves

we
are

in
a
speaking
country
in
not
far
from
as
being
the
scene
of
the
death
of
and
for
its
numerous
glass
factories
and
paper
mills
ha
my
boy
what
do
you
make
of
that
eyes
sparkled
and
he
sent
up
a
great
blue
triumphant
cloud
from
his
cigarette
paper
was
made
in
i
said
the
man
who
wrote
the
note
is
a
you
note
the
peculiar
construction
of
the
sentence
account
of
you
we
have
from
all
quarters
received
a
or
could
not
have
written
that
is
the
who
is
so
uncourteous
to
his
verbs
only
remains
therefore
to
discover
what
is
wanted
by
this
who
writes
upon
paper
and
prefers
wearing
a
mask
to
showing
his
face
here
he
comes
if
i
am
not
mistaken
to
resolve
all
our
doubts
he
spoke
there
was
the
sharp
sound
of
horses
hoofs
and
grating
wheels
against
the
curb
followed
by
a
sharp
pull
at
the
bell
whistled
a
pair
by
the
sound

he
he
continued
glancing
out
of
the
window
a
nice
little
brougham
and
a
pair
of
beauties
a
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
apiece
s
money
in
this
case
if
there
is
nothing
else
i
think
that
i
had
better
go
a
bit
where
you
are
i
am
lost
without
my
this
promises
to
be
interesting
would
be
a
pity
to
miss

your
client

i
may
want
your
help
and
so
may
he
he
comes
down
in
that
armchair
and
give
us
your
best
attention
a
slow
and
heavy
step
which
had
been
heard
upon
the
stairs
and
in
the
passage
paused
immediately
outside
the
door
there
was
a
loud
and
authoritative
tap
in
said
a
man
entered
who
could
hardly
have
been
less
than
six
feet
six
inches
in
height
with
the
chest
and
limbs
of
a
dress
was
rich
with
a
richness
which
would
in
be
looked
upon
as
akin
to
bad
taste
bands
of
astrakhan
were
slashed
across
the
sleeves
and
fronts
of
his
double
breasted
coat
while
the
deep
blue
cloak
which
was
thrown
over
his
shoulders
was
lined
with
flame
coloured
silk
and
secured
at
the
neck
with
a
brooch
which
consisted
of
a
single
flaming
beryl
which
extended
halfway
up
his
calves
and
which
were
trimmed
at
the
tops
with
rich
brown
fur
completed
the
impression
of
barbaric
opulence
which
was
suggested
by
his
whole
appearance
carried
a
broad
brimmed
hat
in
his
hand
while
he
wore
across
the
upper
part
of
his
face
extending
down
past
the
cheekbones
a
black
vizard
mask
which
he
had
apparently
adjusted
that
very
moment
for
his
hand
was
still
raised
to
it
as
he
entered
the
lower
part
of
the
face
he
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
strong
character
with
a
thick
hanging
lip
and
a
long
straight
chin
suggestive
of
resolution
pushed
to
the
length
of
obstinacy
had
my
note
he
asked
with
a
deep
harsh
voice
and
a
strongly
marked
accent

told
you
that
i
would
call

my
friend
and
colleague

is
occasionally
good
enough
to
help
me

my

this

your

a
man
of
honour
and
discretion

i

much

i
rose
to

caught
me
by
the

pushed
me
back
into
my

his
broad

he
by
binding
you
both
to
absolute
secrecy
for
two
years
at
the
end
of
that
time
the

be
of
no
importance

it
is
not

much
to

it
is
of
such
weight

our
strange
visitor
august
person
who
employs
me
wishes
his
agent
to
be
unknown
to
you
and
i
may
confess
at
once
that
the
title
by
which
i
have
just
called
myself
is
not
exactly
my
own
i
was
aware
of
it
said
dryly
circumstances
are
of
great
delicacy
and
every
precaution
has
to
be
taken
to
quench
what
might
grow
to
be
an
immense
scandal
and
seriously

of
the
reigning
families

plainly

the
great
of
hereditary
kings

was
also
aware
of
that
murmured
settling
himself
down
in
his
armchair
and
closing
his
eyes
visitor
glanced
with
some
apparent
surprise
at
the
languid
lounging
figure
of
the
man
who
had
been
no
doubt
depicted
to
him
as
the
most
incisive
reasoner
and
most
energetic
agent
in
slowly
reopened
his
eyes
and
looked
impatiently
at
his
gigantic
client
your
would
condescend
to
state
your
case
he
remarked
i
should
be
better
able
to
advise
you
man
sprang
from
his
chair
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
in
uncontrollable
agitation
with
a
gesture
of
desperation
he
tore
the
mask
from
his
face
and
hurled
it
upon
the
ground
are
right
he
cried
i

should
i
attempt
to
conceal
it

not
spoken

our
strange
visitor
sitting
down
once
more
and
passing
his
hand
over
his
high
white
forehead
you
can
understand
that
i
am
not
accustomed
to
doing
such
business
in
my
own
person
the
matter
was
so
delicate
that
i
could
not
confide
it
to
an
agent
without
putting
myself
in
his
power
i
have
come
incognito
from
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
you

shutting
his
eyes
once
more
facts
are
briefly
these
five
years
ago
during
a
lengthy
visit
to
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
well
known
adventuress
name

no
doubt
familiar
to
you
look
her
up
in
my
index
murmured
without
opening
his
eyes
many
years
he
had
adopted
a
system
of
docketing
all
paragraphs
concerning
men
and
things
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
name
a
subject
or
a
person
on
which
he
could
not
at
once
furnish
information
this
case
i
found
her
biography
sandwiched
in
between
that
of
a
rabbi
and
that
of
a
staff
commander
who
had
written
a
monograph
upon
the

sea

so
as

entangled
with
this
young
person

her
some
compromising
letters
and
is
now
desirous
of

a
pretty
little
problem

a
very
serious
one
to
me

the
reproachfully
indeed
what
does
she

to
do
with
the

how
i
am
about

the
strict
principles

herself
the
very
soul
of
delicacy
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
as
to
my
conduct
would
bring
the
matter
to
an
end
to
send
them
the

she
will
do
it
i
know
that
she
will
do
it
do
not
know
her
but
she
has
a
soul
of
steel
has
the
face
of
the
most
beautiful
of
women
and
the
mind
of
the
most
resolute
of
men
than
i
should
marry
another
woman
there
are
no
lengths
to
which
she
would
not
go
none
are
sure
that
she
has
not
sent
it
yet
i
am
sure
why
she
has
said
that
she
would
send
it
on
the
day
when
the
betrothal
was
publicly
proclaimed
will
be
next
then
we
have
three
days
yet
said
with
a
yawn
is
very
fortunate
as
i
have
one
or
two
matters
of
importance
to
look
into
just
at
present
will
of
course

find
me
at
the

the

shall
drop
you
a
line
to
let
you

how
we

so
i
shall
be
all
anxiety
as
to
money

carte

i
tell
you
that
i
would
give
one
of
the
provinces
of
my
kingdom
to
have
that
photograph
for
present
expenses
took
a
heavy
chamois
leather
bag
from
under
his
cloak
and
laid
it
on
the
table
are
three
hundred
pounds
in
gold
and
seven
hundred
in
notes

said
scribbled
a
receipt
upon
a
sheet
of
his
note
book
and
handed
it
to
him

address
he
asked

took
a
note
of
it
other
question
said
he
the
photograph
a
cabinet
was
good
night
your
and
i
trust
that
we
shall
soon
have
some
good
news
for
you
good
night
he
added
as
the
wheels
of
the
royal
brougham
rolled
down
the
street
you
will
be
good
enough
to
call
to
morrow
afternoon
at
three
o
clock
i
should
like
to
chat
this
little
matter
over
with
you
ii
three
o
clock
precisely
i
was
at
but
had
not
yet
returned
landlady
informed
me
that
he
had
left
the
house
shortly
after
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
sat
down
beside
the
fire
however
with
the
intention
of
awaiting
him
however
long
he
might
be
i
was
already
deeply
interested
in
his
inquiry
for
though
it
was
surrounded
by
none
of
the
grim
and
strange
features
which
were
associated
with
the
two
crimes
which
i
have
already
recorded
still
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
exalted
station
of
his
client
gave
it
a
character
of
its
own
apart
from
the
nature
of
the
investigation
which
my
friend
had
on
hand
there
was
something
in
his
masterly
grasp
of
a
situation
and
his
keen
incisive
reasoning
which
made
it
a
pleasure
to
me
to
study
his
system
of
work
and
to
follow
the
quick
subtle
methods
by
which
he
disentangled
the
most
inextricable
mysteries
accustomed
was
i
to
his
invariable
success
that
the
very
possibility
of
his
failing
had
ceased
to
enter
into
my
head
was
close
upon
four
before
the
door
opened
and
a
drunken
looking
groom
ill
kempt
and
side
whiskered
with
an
inflamed
face
and
disreputable
clothes
walked
into
the
room
as
i
was
to
my
friend
s
amazing
powers
in
the
use
of
disguises
i
had
to
look
three
times
before
i
was
certain
that
it
was
indeed
he
a
nod
he
vanished
into
the
bedroom
whence
he
emerged
in
five
minutes
tweed
suited
and
respectable
as
of
old
his
hands
into
his
pockets
he
stretched
out
his
legs
in
front
of
the
fire
and
laughed
heartily
for
some
minutes
really
he
cried
and
then
he
choked
and
laughed
again
until
he
was
obliged
to
lie
back
limp
and
helpless
in
the
chair
is
it
s
quite
too
funny
i
am
sure
you
could
never
guess
how
i
employed
my
morning
or
what
i
ended
by
doing
i
can
t
imagine
i
suppose
that
you
have
been
watching
the
habits
and
perhaps
the
house
of
so
but
the
sequel
was
rather
unusual
i
will
tell
you
however
i
left
the
house
a
little
after
eight
o
clock
this
morning
in
the
character
of
a
groom
out
of
work
is
a
wonderful
sympathy
and
freemasonry
among
horsey
men
one
of
them
and
you
will
know
all
that
there
is
to
know
i
soon
found
is
a
bijou
villa
with
a
garden
at
the
back
but
built
out
in
front
right
up
to
the
road
two
stories
lock
to
the
door
sitting
room
on
the
right
side
well
furnished
with
long
windows
almost
to
the
floor
and
those
preposterous
window
fasteners
which
a
child
could
open
there
was
nothing
remarkable
save
that
the
passage
window
could
be
reached
from
the
top
of
the
coach
house
i
walked
round
it
and
examined
it
closely
from
every
point
of
view
but
without
noting
anything
else
of
interest
i
then
lounged
down
the
street
and
found
as
i
expected
that
there
was
a
mews
in
a
lane
which
runs
down
by
one
wall
of
the
garden
i
lent
the
ostlers
a
hand
in
rubbing
down
their
horses
and
received
in
exchange
twopence
a
glass
of
half
and
half
two
fills
of
shag
tobacco
and
as
much
information
as
i
could
desire
about
to
say
nothing
of
half
a
dozen
other
people
in
the
neighbourhood
in
whom
i
was
not
in
the
least
interested
but
whose
biographies
i
was
compelled
to
listen
to
what
of
i
asked
she
has
turned
all
the
men
s
heads
down
in
that
part
is
the
daintiest
thing
under
a
bonnet
on
this
planet
say
the
mews
to
a
man
lives
quietly
sings
at
concerts
drives
out
at
five
every
day
and
returns
at
seven
sharp
for
dinner
goes
out
at
other
times
except
when
she
sings
only
one
male
visitor
but
a
good
deal
of
him
is
dark
handsome
and
dashing
never
calls
less
than
once
a
day
and
often
twice
is
a
of
the
the
advantages
of
a
cabman
as
a
confidant
had
driven
him
home
a
dozen
times
from
mews
and
knew
all
about
him
i
had
listened
to
all
they
had
to
tell
i
began
to
walk
up
and
down
near
once
more
and
to
think
over
my
plan
of
campaign
was
evidently
an
important
factor
in
the
matter
was
a
lawyer
sounded
ominous
was
the
relation
between
them
and
what
the
object
of
his
repeated
visits
she
his
client
his
friend
or
his
mistress
the
former
she
had
probably
transferred
the
photograph
to
his
keeping
the
latter
it
was
less
likely
the
issue
of
this
question
depended
whether
i
should
continue
my
work
at
or
turn
my
attention
to
the
gentleman
s
chambers
in
the
was
a
delicate
point
and
it
widened
the
field
of
my
inquiry
i
fear
that
i
bore
you
with
these
details
but
i
have
to
let
you
see
my
little
difficulties
if
you
are
to
understand
the
situation
i
am
following
you
closely
i
answered
i
was
still
balancing
the
matter
in
my
mind
when
a
hansom
cab
drove
up
to
and
a
gentleman
sprang
out
was
a
remarkably
handsome
man
dark
aquiline
and
moustached
evidently
the
man
of
whom
i
had
heard
appeared
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
shouted
to
the
cabman
to
wait
and
brushed
past
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
thoroughly
at
home
was
in
the
house
about
half
an
hour
and
i
could
catch
glimpses
of
him
in
the
windows
of
the
sitting
room
pacing
up
and
down
talking
excitedly
and
waving
his
arms
her
i
could
see
nothing
he
emerged
looking
even
more
flurried
than
before
he
stepped
up
to
the
cab
he
pulled
a
gold
watch
from
his
pocket
and
looked
at
it
earnestly
like
the
devil
he
shouted
first
to
s
in
and
then
to
the
of
in
the
a
guinea
if
you
do
it
in
twenty
minutes
they
went
and
i
was
just
wondering
whether
i
should
not
do
well
to
follow
them
when
up
the
lane
came
a
neat
little
landau
the
coachman
with
his
coat
only
half
buttoned
and
his
tie
under
his
ear
while
all
the
tags
of
his
harness
were
sticking
out
of
the
buckles
hadn
t
pulled
up
before
she
shot
out
of
the
hall
door
and
into
it
i
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
at
the
moment
but
she
was
a
lovely
woman
with
a
face
that
a
man
might
die
for
of
she
cried
and
half
a
sovereign
if
you
reach
it
in
twenty
minutes
was
quite
too
good
to
lose
i
was
just
balancing
whether
i
should
run
for
it
or
whether
i
should
perch
behind
her
landau
when
a
cab
came
through
the
street
driver
looked
twice
at
such
a
shabby
fare
but
i
jumped
in
before
he
could
object
of
said
i
and
half
a
sovereign
if
you
reach
it
in
twenty
minutes
was
twenty
five
minutes
to
twelve
and
of
course
it
was
clear
enough
what
was
in
the
wind
cabby
drove
fast
i
don
t
think
i
ever
drove
faster
but
the
others
were
there
before
us
cab
and
the
landau
with
their
steaming
horses
were
in
front
of
the
door
when
i
arrived
i
paid
the
man
and
hurried
into
the
church
was
not
a
soul
there
save
the
two
whom
i
had
followed
and
a
surpliced
clergyman
who
seemed
to
be
expostulating
with
them
were
all
three
standing
in
a
knot
in
front
of
the
altar
i
lounged
up
the
side
aisle
like
any
other
idler
who
has
dropped
into
a
church
to
my
surprise
the
three
at
the
altar
faced
round
to
me
and
came
running
as
hard
as
he
could
towards
me
he
cried
ll
do
then
i
asked
man
come
only
three
minutes
or
it
won
t
be
legal
i
was
half
dragged
up
to
the
altar
and
before
i
knew
where
i
was
i
found
myself
mumbling
responses
which
were
whispered
in
my
ear
and
vouching
for
things
of
which
i
knew
nothing
and
generally
assisting
in
the
secure
tying
up
of
spinster
to
bachelor
was
all
done
in
an
instant
and
there
was
the
gentleman
thanking
me
on
the
one
side
and
the
lady
on
the
other
while
the
clergyman
beamed
on
me
in
front
was
the
most
preposterous
position
in
which
i
ever
found
myself
in
my
life
and
it
was
the
thought
of
it
that
started
me
laughing
just
now
seems
that
there
had
been
some
informality
about
their
license
that
the
clergyman
absolutely
refused
to
marry
them
without
a
witness
of
some
sort
and
that
my
lucky
appearance
saved
the
bridegroom
from
having
to
sally
out
into
the
streets
in
search
of
a
best
man
bride
gave
me
a
sovereign
and
i
mean
to
wear
it
on
my
watch
chain
in
memory
of
the
occasion
is
a
very
unexpected
turn
of
affairs
said
i
and
what
then
i
found
my
plans
very
seriously
menaced
looked
as
if
the
pair
might
take
an
immediate
departure
and
so
necessitate
very
prompt
and
energetic
measures
on
my
part

they
separated

drive
out
in

park
at
five

usual

as
she
left

i
heard
no
more

away
in
different
directions
and
i
went
off
to
make
my
own
arrangements

beef
and
a
glass
of
beer
he
answered
ringing
the
bell
i
have
been
too
busy
to
think
of
food
and
i
am
likely
to
be
busier

evening

you

in

i
will
make
it
clear
to
you
he
said
as
he
turned
hungrily
on
the
simple
fare
that
our
landlady
had
provided
i
must
discuss
it
while
i
eat
for
i
have
not
much
time

nearly
five

two
hours

must
be
on
the
scene
of
action
or
rather
returns
from
her
drive
at
seven
must
be
at
to
meet
her
what
then
must
leave
that
to
me
i
have
already
arranged
what
is
to
occur
is
only
one
point
on
which
i
must
insist
must
not
interfere
come
what
may
understand
i
am
to
be
neutral
do
nothing
whatever
will
probably
be
some
small
unpleasantness
not
join
in
it
will
end
in
my
being
conveyed
into
the
house

five

for
i
will
be
visible
to
you
when
i
raise
my
hand
so
you
will
throw
into
the
room
what
i
give
you
to
throw
and
will
at
the
same
time
raise
the

nothing

it
still
wanted
ten
minutes
to
the
hour
when
we
found
ourselves
in
was
already
dusk
and
the
lamps
were
just
being
lighted

we

up

down

waiting
for
the
coming
of
its
occupant
house
was
just
such
as
i
had
pictured
it
from
succinct
description
but
the
locality
appeared
to
be
less
private
than
i
expected
the
contrary
for
a
small
street
in
a
quiet
neighbourhood
it
was
remarkably
animated
was
a
group
of
shabbily
dressed
men
smoking
and
laughing
in
a
corner
a
scissors
grinder
with
his
wheel
two
guardsmen
who
were
flirting
with
a
nurse
girl
and
several
well
dressed
young
men
who
were
lounging
up
and
down
with
cigars
in
their
mouths

we
paced
to

fro
in

of
the
house
this
marriage
rather
simplifies
matters
photograph
becomes
a
double
edged
weapon
now
chances
are
that
she
would
be
as
averse
to
its
being
seen
by
as
our
client
is
to
its
coming
to
the
eyes
of
his
princess
the
question
is
are
we
to
find
the
photograph
indeed
is
most
unlikely
that
she
carries
it
about
with
her
is
cabinet
size
large
for
easy
concealment

is

her
waylaid

attempts
of
the
sort
have
already
been
made
may
take
it
then
that
she
does
not
carry
it
about
with
her
then
banker
or
her
lawyer
is
that
double
possibility
i
am
inclined
to
think
neither
are
naturally
secretive
and
they
like
to
do
their
own
secreting
should
she
hand
it
over
to
anyone
else
could
trust
her
own
guardianship
but
she
could
not
tell
what
indirect
or
political
influence
might
be
brought
to
bear
upon
a
business
man
remember
that
she
had
resolved
to
use
it
within
a
few
days

where
she
can

not
know
how
to
look
how

you
look
i
will
not
look
then
i
will
get
her
to

me
she

spoke
the
gleam
of
the
side
lights
of
a
carriage
came
round
the
curve
of
the
avenue
was
a
smart
little
landau
which
rattled
up
to
the
door
of
it
pulled
up
one
of
the
loafing
men
at
the
corner
dashed
forward
to
open
the
door
in
the
hope
of
earning
a
copper
but
was
elbowed
away
by
another
loafer
who
had
rushed
up
with
the
same
intention
a
fierce
quarrel
broke
out
which
was
increased
by
the
two
guardsmen
who
took
sides
with
one
of
the
loungers
and
by
the
scissors
grinder
who
was
equally
hot
upon
the
other
side
a
blow
was
struck
and
in
an
instant
the
lady
who
had
stepped
from
her
carriage
was
the
centre
of
a
little
knot
of
flushed
and
struggling
men
who
struck
savagely
at
each
other
with
their
fists
and
sticks
dashed
into
the
crowd
to
protect
the
lady
but
just
as
he
reached
her
he
gave
a
cry
and
dropped
to
the
ground
with
the
blood
running
freely
down
his
face
his
fall
the
guardsmen
took
to
their
heels
in
one
direction
and
the
loungers
in
the
other
while
a
number
of
better
dressed
people
who
had
watched
the
scuffle
without
taking
part
in
it
crowded
in
to
help
the
lady
and
to
attend
to
the
injured
man
as
i
will
still
call
her
had
hurried
up
the
steps
but
she
stood
at
the
top
with
her
superb
figure
outlined
against
the
lights
of
the
hall
looking
back
into
the
street
the
poor
gentleman
much
hurt
she
asked
is
dead
cried
several
voices
no
there
s
life
in
him
shouted
another
he
ll
be
gone
before
you
can
get
him
to
hospital
s
a
brave
fellow
said
a
woman
would
have
had
the
lady
s
purse
and
watch
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
him
were
a
gang
and
a
rough
one
too
he
s
breathing
now
can
t
lie
in
the
street
we
bring
him
in
marm
him
into
the
sitting
room
is
a
comfortable
sofa
way
please
and
solemnly
he
was
borne
into
and
laid
out
in
the
principal
room
while
i
still
observed
the
proceedings
from
my
post
by
the
window
lamps
had
been
lit
but
the
blinds
had
not
been
drawn
so
that
i
could
see
as
he
lay
upon
the
couch
i
do
not
know
whether
he
was
seized
with
compunction
at
that
moment
for
the
part
he
was
playing
but
i
know
that
i
never
felt
more
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
in
my
life
than
when
i
saw
the
beautiful
creature
against
whom
i
was
conspiring
or
the
grace
and
kindliness
with
which
she
waited
upon
the
injured
man
yet
it
would
be
the
blackest
treachery
to
to
draw
back
now
from
the
part
which
he
had
intrusted
to
me
i
hardened
my
heart
and
took
the
smoke
rocket
from
under
my
ulster
all
i
thought
we
are
not
injuring
her
are
but
preventing
her
from
injuring
another
had
sat
up
upon
the
couch
and
i
saw
him
motion
like
a
man
who
is
in
need
of
air
a
maid
rushed
across
and
threw
open
the
window
the
same
instant
i
saw
him
raise
his
hand
and
at
the
signal
i
tossed
my
rocket
into
the
room
with
a
cry
of
word
was
no
sooner
out
of
my
mouth
than
the
whole
crowd
of
spectators
well
dressed
and
ill
gentlemen
ostlers
and
servant
maids
joined
in
a
general
shriek
of
clouds
of
smoke
curled
through
the
room
and
out
at
the
open
window
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
rushing
figures
and
a
moment
later
the
voice
of
from
within
assuring
them
that
it
was
a
false
alarm
through
the
shouting
crowd
i
made
my
way
to
the
corner
of
the
street
and
in
ten
minutes
was
rejoiced
to
find
my
friend
s
arm
in
mine
and
to
get
away
from
the
scene
of
uproar
walked
swiftly
and
in
silence
for
some
few
minutes
until
we
had
turned
down
one
of
the
quiet
streets
which
lead
towards
the
did
it
very
nicely
he
remarked
could
have
been
better
is
all
right
have
the
photograph
i
know
where
it
is
how
did
you
find
out
showed
me
as
i
told
you
she
would
i
am
still
in
the
dark
i
do
not
wish
to
make
a
mystery
said
he
laughing
matter
was
perfectly
simple
of
course
saw
that
everyone
in
the
street
was
an
accomplice
were
all
engaged
for
the
evening
i
guessed
as
much
when
the
row
broke
out
i
had
a
little
moist
red
paint
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
i
rushed
forward
fell
down
clapped
my
hand
to
my
face
and
became
a
piteous
spectacle
is
an
old
trick
also
i
could
fathom
they
carried
me
in
was
bound
to
have
me
in
else
could
she
do
into
her
sitting
room
which
was
the
very
room
which
i
suspected
lay
between
that
and
her
bedroom
and
i
was
determined
to
see
which
laid
me
on
a
couch
i
motioned
for
air
they
were
compelled
to
open
the
window
and
you
had
your
chance
did
that
help
you
was
all
important
a
woman
thinks
that
her
house
is
on
fire
her
instinct
is
at
once
to
rush
to
the
thing
which
she
values
most
is
a
perfectly
overpowering
impulse
and
i
have
more
than
once
taken
advantage
of
it
the
case
of
the
substitution
scandal
it
was
of
use
to
me
and
also
in
the
business
a
married
woman
grabs
at
her
baby
an
unmarried
one
reaches
for
her
jewel
box
it
was
clear
to
me
that
our
lady
of
to
day
had
nothing
in
the
house
more
precious
to
her
than
what
we
are
in
quest
of
would
rush
to
secure
it
alarm
of
fire
was
admirably
done

and
shouting
were
enough
to
shake
nerves
of
steel

beautifully

a
recess
behind
a
sliding
panel
just
above
the
right
bell
pull
was
there
in
an
instant
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
as
she
half
drew
it
out
i
cried
out
that
it
was
a
false
alarm
she
replaced
it
glanced
at
the
rocket
rushed
from
the
room
and
i
have
not
seen
her
since
i
rose
and
making
my
excuses
escaped
from
the
house
i
hesitated
whether
to
attempt
to
secure
the
photograph
at
once
but
the
coachman
had
come
in
and
as
he
was
watching
me
narrowly
it
seemed
safer
to
wait
a
little
over
precipitance

ruin
all
now
i
asked

is
practically
finished

and
with
you
if
you
care
to
come
with
us
will
be
shown
into
the
sitting
room
to
wait
for
the
lady
but
it
is
probable
that
when
she
comes
she
may
find
neither
us
nor
the
photograph
might
be
a
satisfaction
to
his
to
regain
it
with
his
own
hands
when
will
you
call
eight
in
the
morning

clear
field

searching
his
pockets
for
the
key
when
someone
passing
said
night
were
several
people
on
the
pavement
at
the
time
but
the
greeting
appeared
to
come
from
a
slim
youth
in
an
ulster
who
had
hurried
by
i
ve
heard
that
voice
before

staring
down
the
dimly
lit
street
i
wonder
who
the
deuce
that
could
have
been
iii
i
slept
at
that
night
and
we
were
engaged
upon
our
toast
and
coffee
in
the
morning
when
the

room

cried
grasping
by

eagerly
into
his
face

is
no

true

i
wish
she
had
been
of
my
own
station
a
queen
she
would
have
made
relapsed
into
a
moody
silence
which
was
not
broken
until
we
drew
up
in
door
of
was
open
and
an
elderly
woman
stood
upon
the
steps
watched
us
with
a
sardonic
eye
as
we
stepped
from
the
brougham
i
believe
said
she

am
answered
my
companion
looking
at
her
with
a
questioning
and
rather
startled
gaze
mistress
told
me
that
you
were
likely
to
call
left
this
morning
with
her
husband
by
the
train
from
for
the
staggered
back

with
chagrin
and
surprise
you

that
she
has
left
to
return
the
papers
asked
the
hoarsely
is
lost
shall
see
pushed
past
the
servant
and
rushed
into
the
drawing
room
followed
by
the
and
myself
furniture
was
scattered
about
in
every
direction
with
dismantled
shelves
and
open
drawers
as
if
the
lady
had
hurriedly
ransacked
them
before
her
flight
rushed
at
the
bell
pull
tore
back
a
small
sliding
shutter
and
plunging
in
his
hand
pulled
out
a
photograph
and
a
letter
photograph
was
of
herself
in
evening
dress
the
letter
was
superscribed
to
be
left
till
called
for
friend
tore
it
open
and
we
all
three
read
it
together
was
dated
at
midnight
of
the
preceding
night
and
ran
in
this
way
my
dear
mr
sherlock
holmes
really
did
it
very
well
took
me
in
completely
after
the
alarm
of
fire
i
had
not
a
suspicion
then
when
i
found
how
i
had
betrayed
myself
i
began
to
think
i
had
been
warned
against
you
months
ago
i
had
been
told
that
if
the
employed
an
agent
it
would
certainly
be
you
your
address
had
been
given
me
with
all
this
you
made
me
reveal
what
you
wanted
to
know
after
i
became
suspicious
i
found
it
hard
to
think
evil
of
such
a
dear
kind
old
clergyman
you
know
i
have
been
trained
as
an
actress
myself
costume
is
nothing
new
to
me
i
often
take
advantage
of
the
freedom
which
it
gives
i
sent
the
coachman
to
watch
you
ran
up
stairs
got
into
my
walking
clothes
as
i
call
them
and
came
down
just
as
you
departed
i
followed
you
to
your
door
and
so
made
sure
that
i
was
really
an
object
of
interest
to
the
celebrated
i
rather
imprudently
wished
you
good
night
and
started
for
the
to
see
my
husband
both
thought
the
best
resource
was
flight
when
pursued
by
so
formidable
an
antagonist
so
you
will
find
the
nest
empty
when
you
call
to
morrow
to
the
photograph
your
client
may
rest
in
peace
i
love
and
am
loved
by
a
better
man
than
he
may
do
what
he
will
without
hindrance
from
one
whom
he
has
cruelly
wronged
i
keep
it
only
to
safeguard
myself
and
to
preserve
a
weapon
which
will
always
secure
me
from
any
steps
which
he
might
take
in
the
future
i
leave
a
photograph
which
he
might
care
to
possess
and
i
remain
dear
truly
yours

a
woman
oh
what
a
woman
cried
the
of
when
we
had
all
three
read
this
epistle
i
not
tell
you
how
quick
and
resolute
she
was
she
not
have
made
an
admirable
queen
it
not
a
pity
that
she
was
not
on
my
level
what
i
have
seen
of
the
lady
she
seems
indeed
to
be
on
a
very
different
level
to
your
said
coldly
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
bring
your
s
business
to
a
more
successful
conclusion
the
contrary
my
dear
sir
cried
the
nothing
could
be
more
successful
i
know
that
her
word
is
inviolate
photograph
is
now
as
safe
as
if
it
were
in
the
fire
i
am
glad
to
hear
your
say
so
i
am
immensely
indebted
to
you
tell
me
in
what
way
i
can
reward
you

slipped
an
emerald
snake

from
his
finger
and
held
it
out
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand

something
which
i
should
value
even
more
highly
said

but
to
name
it

at
him
in
amazement

cried
if
you
wish
it
i
thank
your
there
is
no
more
to
be
done
in
the
matter
i
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
a
very
good
morning
bowed
and
turning
away
without
observing
the
hand
which
the
had
stretched
out
to
him
he
set
off
in
my
company
for
his
chambers
that
was
how
a
great
scandal
threatened
to
affect
the
kingdom
of
and
how
the
best
plans
of
were
beaten
by
a
woman
s
wit
used
to
make
merry
over
the
cleverness
of
women
but
i
have
not
heard
him
do
it
of
late
when
he
speaks
of
or
when
he
refers
to
her
photograph
it
is
always
under
the
honourable
title
of
the
woman
adventure
ii
the
red
headed
league
i
had
called
upon
my
friend
one
day
in
the
autumn
of
last
year
and
found
him
in
deep
conversation
with
a
very
stout
florid
faced
elderly
gentleman
with
fiery
red
hair
an
apology
for
my
intrusion
i
was
about
to
withdraw
when
pulled
me
abruptly
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
could
not
possibly
have
come
at
a
better
time
my
dear
he
said
cordially
i
was
afraid
that
you
were
engaged
i
am
much
so
i
can
wait
in
the
next
room
at
all
gentleman
has
been
my
partner
and
helper
in
many
of
my
most
successful
cases
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
be
of
the
utmost
use
to
me
in
yours
also
stout
gentleman
half
rose
from
his
chair
and
gave
a
bob
of
greeting
with
a
quick
little
questioning
glance
from
his
small
fat
encircled
eyes
the
settee
said
relapsing
into
his
armchair
and
putting
his
fingertips
together
as
was
his
custom
when
in
judicial
moods
i
know
my
dear
that
you
share
my
love
of
all
that
is
bizarre
and
outside
the
conventions
and
humdrum
routine
of
everyday
life
have
shown
your
relish
for
it
by
the
enthusiasm
which
has
prompted
you
to
chronicle
and
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
somewhat
to
embellish
so
many
of
my
own
little
adventures
cases
have
indeed
been
of
the
greatest
interest
to
me
i
observed
will
remember
that
i
remarked
the
other
day
just
before
we
went
into
the
very
simple
problem
presented
by
that
for
strange
effects
and
extraordinary
combinations
we
must
go
to
life
itself
which
is
always
far
more
daring
than
any
effort
of
the
imagination
a
proposition
which
i
took
the
liberty
of
doubting
did
but
none
the
less
you
must
come
round
to
my
view
for
otherwise
i
shall
keep
on
piling
fact
upon
fact
on
you
until
your
reason
breaks
down
under
them
and
acknowledges
me
to
be
right
here
has
been
good
enough
to
call
upon
me
this
morning
and
to
begin
a
narrative
which
promises
to
be
one
of
the
most
singular
which
i
have
listened
to
for
some
time
have
heard
me
remark
that
the
strangest
and
most
unique
things
are
very
often
connected
not
with
the
larger
but
with
the
smaller
crimes
and
occasionally
indeed
where
there
is
room
for
doubt
whether
any
positive
crime
has
been
committed
far
as
i
have
heard
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
whether
the
present
case
is
an
instance
of
crime
or
not
but
the
course
of
events
is
certainly
among
the
most
singular
that
i
have
ever
listened
to
you
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
recommence
your
narrative
i
ask
you
not
merely
because
my
friend
has
not
heard
the
opening
part
but
also
because
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
story
makes
me
anxious
to
have
every
possible
detail
from
your
lips
a
rule
when
i
have
heard
some
slight
indication
of
the
course
of
events
i
am
able
to
guide
myself
by
the
thousands
of
other
similar
cases
which
occur
to
my
memory
the
present
instance
i
am
forced
to
admit
that
the
facts
are
to
the
best
of
my
belief
unique
portly
client
puffed
out
his
chest
with
an
appearance
of
some
little
pride
and
pulled
a
dirty
and
wrinkled
newspaper
from
the
inside
pocket
of
his
greatcoat
he
glanced
down
the
advertisement
column
with
his
head
thrust
forward
and
the
paper
flattened
out
upon
his
knee
i
took
a
good
look
at
the
man
and
endeavoured
after
the
fashion
of
my
companion
to
read
the
indications
which
might
be
presented
by
his
dress
or
appearance
i
did
not
gain
very
much
however
by
my
inspection
visitor
bore
every
mark
of
being
an
average
commonplace
tradesman
obese
pompous
and
slow
wore
rather
baggy
grey
shepherd
s
check
trousers
a
not
over
clean
black
frock
coat
unbuttoned
in
the
front
and
a
drab
waistcoat
with
a
heavy
brassy
chain
and
a
square
pierced
bit
of
metal
dangling
down
as
an
ornament
a
frayed
top
hat
and
a
faded
brown
overcoat
with
a
wrinkled
velvet
collar
lay
upon
a
chair
beside
him
look
as
i
would
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
man
save
his
blazing
red
head
and
the
expression
of
extreme
chagrin
and
discontent
upon
his
features
quick
eye
took
in
my
occupation
and
he
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
as
he
noticed
my
questioning
glances
the
obvious
facts
that
he
has
at
some
time
done
manual
labour
that
he
takes
snuff
that
he
is
a
that
he
has
been
in
and
that
he
has
done
a
considerable
amount
of
writing
lately
i
can
deduce
nothing
else
started
up
in
his
chair
with
his
forefinger
upon
the
paper
but
his
eyes
upon
my
companion
in
the
name
of
good
fortune
did
you
know
all
that
he
asked
did
you
know
for
example
that
i
did
manual
labour
s
as
true
as
gospel
for
i
began
as
a
ship
s
carpenter
hands
my
dear
sir
right
hand
is
quite
a
size
larger
than
your
left
have
worked
with
it
and
the
muscles
are
more
developed
the
snuff
then
and
the
i
won
t
insult
your
intelligence
by
telling
you
how
i
read
that
especially
as
rather
against
the
strict
rules
of
your
order
you
use
an
arc
and
compass
breastpin
of
course
i
forgot
that
the
writing
else
can
be
indicated
by
that
right
cuff
so
very
shiny
for
five
inches
and
the
left
one
with
the
smooth
patch
near
the
elbow
where
you
rest
it
upon
the
desk
but
fish
that
you
have
tattooed
immediately
above
your
right
wrist
could
only
have
been
done
in
i
have
made
a
small
study
of
tattoo
marks
and
have
even
contributed
to
the
literature
of
the
subject
trick
of
staining
the
fishes
scales
of
a
delicate
pink
is
quite
peculiar
to
in
addition
i
see
a
coin
hanging
from
your
watch
chain
the
matter
becomes
even
more
simple
laughed
heavily
i
never
said
he
i
thought
at
first
that
you
had
done
something
clever
but
i
see
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
after
all
i
begin
to
think
said
that
i
make
a
mistake
in
explaining
ignotum
pro
magnifico
you
know
and
my
poor
little
reputation
such
as
it
is
will
suffer
shipwreck
if
i
am
so
candid
you
not
find
the
advertisement
i
have
got
it
now
he
answered
with
his
thick
red
finger
planted
halfway
down
the
column
it
is
is
what
began
it
all
just
read
it
for
yourself
sir
i
took
the
paper
from
him
and
read
as
follows
to
the
red
headed
league
account
of
the
bequest
of
the
late
of
u
s
a
there
is
now
another
vacancy
open
which
entitles
a
member
of
the
to
a
salary
of
pounds
a
week
for
purely
nominal
services
red
headed
men
who
are
sound
in
body
and
mind
and
above
the
age
of
twenty
one
years
are
eligible
in
person
on
at
eleven
o
clock
to
at
the
offices
of
the
s
on
earth
does
this
mean
i
ejaculated
after
i
had
twice
read
over
the
extraordinary
announcement
chuckled
and
wriggled
in
his
chair
as
was
his
habit
when
in
high
spirits
is
a
little
off
the
beaten
track
isn
t
it
said
he
now
off
you
go
at
scratch
and
tell
us
all
about
yourself
your
household
and
the
effect
which
this
advertisement
had
upon
your
fortunes
will
first
make
a
note
of
the
paper
and
the
date
is
of
two
months
ago
good
it
is
just
as
i
have
been
telling
you
said
mopping
his
forehead
i
have
a
small
pawnbroker
s
business
at
near
the
s
not
a
very
large
affair
and
of
late
years
it
has
not
done
more
than
just
give
me
a
living
i
used
to
be
able
to
keep
two
assistants
but
now
i
only
keep
one
and
i
would
have
a
job
to
pay
him
but
that
he
is
willing
to
come
for
half
wages
so
as
to
learn
the
business
is
the
name
of
this
obliging
youth
asked
name
is
and
he
s
not
such
a
youth
either
s
hard
to
say
his
age
i
should
not
wish
a
smarter
assistant
and
i
know
very
well
that
he
could
better
himself
and
earn
twice
what
i
am
able
to
give
him
after
all
if
he
is
satisfied
why
should
i
put
ideas
in
his
head
indeed
seem
most
fortunate
in
having
an
employ
who
comes
under
the
full
market
price
is
not
a
common
experience
among
employers
in
this
age
i
don
t
know
that
your
assistant
is
not
as
remarkable
as
your
advertisement
he
has
his
faults
too
said
was
such
a
fellow
for
photography
away
with
a
camera
when
he
ought
to
be
improving
his
mind
and
then
diving
down
into
the
cellar
like
a
rabbit
into
its
hole
to
develop
his
pictures
is
his
main
fault
but
on
the
whole
he
s
a
good
worker
s
no
vice
in
him
is
still
with
you
i
presume
sir
and
a
girl
of
fourteen
who
does
a
bit
of
simple
cooking
and
keeps
the
place
clean
that
s
all
i
have
in
the
house
for
i
am
a
widower
and
never
had
any
family
live
very
quietly
sir
the
three
of
us
and
we
keep
a
roof
over
our
heads
and
pay
our
debts
if
we
do
nothing
more
first
thing
that
put
us
out
was
that
advertisement
he
came
down
into
the
office
just
this
day
eight
weeks
with
this
very
paper
in
his
hand
and
he
says
i
wish
to
the
that
i
was
a
red
headed
man
that
i
asks
says
he
here
s
another
vacancy
on
the
of
the
headed
s
worth
quite
a
little
fortune
to
any
man
who
gets
it
and
i
understand
that
there
are
more
vacancies
than
there
are
men
so
that
the
trustees
are
at
their
wits
end
what
to
do
with
the
money
my
hair
would
only
change
colour
here
s
a
nice
little
crib
all
ready
for
me
to
step
into
what
is
it
then
i
asked
see
i
am
a
very
stay
at
home
man
and
as
my
business
came
to
me
instead
of
my
having
to
go
to
it
i
was
often
weeks
on
end
without
putting
my
foot
over
the
door
mat
that
way
i
didn
t
know
much
of
what
was
going
on
outside
and
i
was
always
glad
of
a
bit
of
news
you
never
heard
of
the
of
the
headed
he
asked
with
his
eyes
open
i
wonder
at
that
for
you
are
eligible
yourself
for
one
of
the
vacancies
what
are
they
worth
i
asked
merely
a
couple
of
hundred
a
year
but
the
work
is
slight
and
it
need
not
interfere
very
much
with
one
s
other
occupations
you
can
easily
think
that
that
made
me
prick
up
my
ears
for
the
business
has
not
been
over
good
for
some
years
and
an
extra
couple
of
hundred
would
have
been
very
handy
me
all
about
it
said
i
said
he
showing
me
the
advertisement
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
the
has
a
vacancy
and
there
is
the
address
where
you
should
apply
for
particulars
far
as
i
can
make
out
the
was
founded
by
an
millionaire
who
was
very
peculiar
in
his
ways
was
himself
red
headed
and
he
had
a
great
sympathy
for
all
red
headed
men
so
when
he
died
it
was
found
that
he
had
left
his
enormous
fortune
in
the
hands
of
trustees
with
instructions
to
apply
the
interest
to
the
providing
of
easy
berths
to
men
whose
hair
is
of
that
colour
all
i
hear
it
is
splendid
pay
and
very
little
to
do
said
i
there
would
be
millions
of
red
headed
men
who
would
apply
so
many
as
you
might
think
he
answered
see
it
is
really
confined
to
and
to
grown
men
had
started
from
when
he
was
young
and
he
wanted
to
do
the
old
town
a
good
turn
again
i
have
heard
it
is
no
use
your
applying
if
your
hair
is
light
red
or
dark
red
or
anything
but
real
bright
blazing
fiery
red
if
you
cared
to
apply
you
would
just
walk
in
but
perhaps
it
would
hardly
be
worth
your
while
to
put
yourself
out
of
the
way
for
the
sake
of
a
few
hundred
pounds
it
is
a
fact
gentlemen
as
you
may
see
for
yourselves
that
my
hair
is
of
a
very
full
and
rich
tint
so
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
there
was
to
be
any
competition
in
the
matter
i
stood
as
good
a
chance
as
any
man
that
i
had
ever
met
seemed
to
know
so
much
about
it
that
i
thought
he
might
prove
useful
so
i
just
ordered
him
to
put
up
the
shutters
for
the
day
and
to
come
right
away
with
me
was
very
willing
to
have
a
holiday
so
we
shut
the
business
up
and
started
off
for
the
address
that
was
given
us
in
the
advertisement
i
never
hope
to
see
such
a
sight
as
that
again
north
south
east
and
west
every
man
who
had
a
shade
of
red
in
his
hair
had
tramped
into
the
city
to
answer
the
advertisement
was
choked
with
red
headed
folk
and
s
looked
like
a
coster
s
orange
barrow
i
should
not
have
thought
there
were
so
many
in
the
whole
country
as
were
brought
together
by
that
single
advertisement
shade
of
colour
they
were
straw
lemon
orange
brick
setter
liver
clay
but
as
said
there
were
not
many
who
had
the
real
vivid
flame
coloured
tint
i
saw
how
many
were
waiting
i
would
have
given
it
up
in
despair
but
would
not
hear
of
it
he
did
it
i
could
not
imagine
but
he
pushed
and
pulled
and
butted
until
he
got
me
through
the
crowd
and
right
up
to
the
steps
which
led
to
the
office
was
a
double
stream
upon
the
stair
some
going
up
in
hope
and
some
coming
back
dejected
but
we
wedged
in
as
well
as
we
could
and
soon
found
ourselves
in
the
office
experience
has
been
a
most
entertaining
one
remarked
as
his
client
paused
and
refreshed
his
memory
with
a
huge
pinch
of
snuff
continue
your
very
interesting
statement
was
nothing
in
the
office
but
a
couple
of
wooden
chairs
and
a
deal
table
behind
which
sat
a
small
man
with
a
head
that
was
even
redder
than
mine
said
a
few
words
to
each
candidate
as
he
came
up
and
then
he
always
managed
to
find
some
fault
in
them
which
would
disqualify
them
a
vacancy
did
not
seem
to
be
such
a
very
easy
matter
after
all
when
our
turn
came
the
little
man
was
much
more
favourable
to
me
than
to
any
of
the
others
and
he
closed
the
door
as
we
entered
so
that
he
might
have
a
private
word
with
us
is
said
my
assistant
and
he
is
willing
to
fill
a
vacancy
in
the
he
is
admirably
suited
for
it
the
other
answered
has
every
requirement
i
cannot
recall
when
i
have
seen
anything
so
fine
took
a
step
backward
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
and
gazed
at
my
hair
until
i
felt
quite
bashful
suddenly
he
plunged
forward
wrung
my
hand
and
congratulated
me
warmly
on
my
success
would
be
injustice
to
hesitate
said
he
will
however
i
am
sure
excuse
me
for
taking
an
obvious
precaution
that
he
seized
my
hair
in
both
his
hands
and
tugged
until
i
yelled
with
the
pain
is
water
in
your
eyes
said
he
as
he
released
me
i
perceive
that
all
is
as
it
should
be
we
have
to
be
careful
for
we
have
twice
been
deceived
by
wigs
and
once
by
paint
i
could
tell
you
tales
of
cobbler
s
wax
which
would
disgust
you
with
human
nature
stepped
over
to
the
window
and
shouted
through
it
at
the
top
of
his
voice
that
the
vacancy
was
filled
a
groan
of
disappointment
came
up
from
below
and
the
folk
all
trooped
away
in
different
directions
until
there
was
not
a
red
head
to
be
seen
except
my
own
and
that
of
the
manager
name
said
he
is
and
i
am
myself
one
of
the
pensioners
upon
the
fund
left
by
our
noble
benefactor
you
a
married
man
you
a
family
i
answered
that
i
had
not
face
fell
immediately
me
he
said
gravely
that
is
very
serious
indeed
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
that
fund
was
of
course
for
the
propagation
and
spread
of
the
red
heads
as
well
as
for
their
maintenance
is
exceedingly
unfortunate
that
you
should
be
a
bachelor
face
lengthened
at
this
for
i
thought
that
i
was
not
to
have
the
vacancy
after
all
but
after
thinking
it
over
for
a
few
minutes
he
said
that
it
would
be
all
right
the
case
of
another
said
he
the
objection
might
be
fatal
but
we
must
stretch
a
point
in
favour
of
a
man
with
such
a
head
of
hair
as
yours
shall
you
be
able
to
enter
upon
your
new
duties
it
is
a
little
awkward
for
i
have
a
business
already
said
i
never
mind
about
that
said
i
should
be
able
to
look
after
that
for
you
would
be
the
hours
i
asked
to
two
a
pawnbroker
s
business
is
mostly
done
of
an
evening
especially
and
evening
which
is
just
before
pay
day
so
it
would
suit
me
very
well
to
earn
a
little
in
the
mornings
i
knew
that
my
assistant
was
a
good
man
and
that
he
would
see
to
anything
that
turned
up
would
suit
me
very
well
said
i
the
pay
pounds
a
week
the
work
purely
nominal
do
you
call
purely
nominal
you
have
to
be
in
the
office
or
at
least
in
the
building
the
whole
time
you
leave
you
forfeit
your
whole
position
forever
will
is
very
clear
upon
that
point
don
t
comply
with
the
conditions
if
you
budge
from
the
office
during
that
time
s
only
four
hours
a
day
and
i
should
not
think
of
leaving
said
i
excuse
will
avail
said
neither
sickness
nor
business
nor
anything
else
you
must
stay
or
you
lose
your
billet

work
to
copy
out
the

the
first
volume
of
it
in
that
press
must
find
your
own
ink
pens
and
blotting
paper
but
we
provide
this
table
and
chair
you
be
ready
to
morrow
i
answered
good
bye
and
let
me
congratulate
you
once
more
on
the
important
position
which
you
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
gain
bowed
me
out
of
the
room
and
i
went
home
with
my
assistant
hardly
knowing
what
to
say
or
do
i
was
so
pleased
at
my
own
good
fortune
i
thought
over
the
matter
all
day
and
by
evening
i
was
in
low
spirits
again
for
i
had
quite
persuaded
myself
that
the
whole
affair
must
be
some
great
hoax
or
fraud
though
what
its
object
might
be
i
could
not
imagine
seemed
altogether
past
belief
that
anyone
could
make
such
a
will
or
that
they
would
pay
such
a
sum
for
doing
anything
so
simple
as
copying
out
the
did
what
he
could
to
cheer
me
up
but
by
bedtime
i
had
reasoned
myself
out
of
the
whole
thing
in
the
morning
i
determined
to
have
a
look
at
it
anyhow
so
i
bought
a
penny
bottle
of
ink
and
with
a
quill
pen
and
seven
sheets
of
foolscap
paper
i
started
off
for
s
to
my
surprise
and
delight
everything
was
as
right
as
possible
table
was
set
out
ready
for
me
and
was
there
to
see
that
i
got
fairly
to
work
started
me
off
upon
the
letter
a
and
then
he
left
me
but
he
would
drop
in
from
time
to
time
to
see
that
all
was
right
with
me
two
o
clock
he
bade
me
good
day
complimented
me
upon
the
amount
that
i
had
written
and
locked
the
door
of
the
office
after
me
went
on
day
after
day
and
on
the
manager
came
in
and
planked
down
four
golden
sovereigns
for
my
week
s
work
was
the
same
next
week
and
the
same
the
week
after
morning
i
was
there
at
ten
and
every
afternoon
i
left
at
two
degrees
took
to
coming
in
only
once
of
a
morning
and
then
after
a
time
he
did
not
come
in
at
all
of
course
i
never
dared
to
leave
the
room
for
an
instant
for
i
was
not
sure
when
he
might
come
and
the
billet
was
such
a
good
one
and
suited
me
so
well
that
i
would
not
risk
the
loss
of
it
weeks
passed
away
like
this
and
i
had
written
about
and
and
and
and
and
hoped
with
diligence
that
i
might
get
on
to
the
b
s
before
very
long
cost
me
something
in
foolscap
and
i
had
pretty
nearly
filled
a
shelf
with
my
writings
then
suddenly
the
whole
business
came
to
an
end
an
end
sir
no
later
than
this
morning
i
went
to
my
work
as
usual
at
ten
o
clock
but
the
door
was
shut
and
locked
with
a
little
square
of
cardboard
hammered
on
to
the
middle
of
the
panel
with
a
tack
it
is
and
you
can
read
for
yourself
held
up
a
piece
of
white
cardboard
about
the
size
of
a
sheet
of
note
paper
read
in
this
fashion
the
red
headed
league
is
dissolved
and
i
surveyed
this
curt
announcement
and
the
rueful
face
behind
it
until
the
comical
side
of
the
affair
so
completely
overtopped
every
other
consideration
that
we
both
burst
out
into
a
roar
of
laughter
i
cannot
see
that
there
is
anything
very
funny
cried
our
client
flushing
up
to
the
roots
of
his
flaming
head
you
can
do
nothing
better
than
laugh
at
me
i
can
go
elsewhere
no
cried
shoving
him
back
into
the
chair
from
which
he
had
half
risen
i
really
wouldn
t
miss
your
case
for
the
world
is
most
refreshingly
unusual
there
is
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
something
just
a
little
funny
about
it
what
steps
did
you
take
when
you
found
the
card
upon
the
door
i
was
staggered
sir
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
called
at
the
offices
round
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
know
anything
about
it
i
went
to
the
landlord
who
is
an
accountant
living
on
the
ground
floor
and
i
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
me
what
had
become
of
the
headed
said
that
he
had
never
heard
of
any
such
body
i
asked
him
who
was
answered
that
the
name
was
new
to
him
said
i
the
gentleman
at
the
red
headed
man
said
he
his
name
was
was
a
solicitor
and
was
using
my
room
as
a
temporary
convenience
until
his
new
premises
were
ready
moved
out
yesterday
could
i
find
him
at
his
new
offices
did
tell
me
the
address
near
s
i
started
off
but
when
i
got
to
that
address
it
was
a
manufactory
of
artificial
knee
caps
and
no
one
in
it
had
ever
heard
of
either
or
what
did
you
do
then
asked
i
went
home
to
and
i
took
the
advice
of
my
assistant
he
could
not
help
me
in
any
way
could
only
say
that
if
i
waited
i
should
hear
by
post
that
was
not
quite
good
enough
i
did
not
wish
to
lose
such
a
place
without
a
struggle
so
as
i
had
heard
that
you
were
good
enough
to
give
advice
to
poor
folk
who
were
in
need
of
it
i
came
right
away
to
you
you
did
very
wisely
said
case
is
an
exceedingly
remarkable
one
and
i
shall
be
happy
to
look
into
it
what
you
have
told
me
i
think
that
it
is
possible
that
graver
issues
hang
from
it
than
might
at
first
sight
appear
enough
said
i
have
lost
four
pound
a
week
far
as
you
are
personally
concerned
remarked
i
do
not
see
that
you
have
any
grievance
against
this
extraordinary
league
the
contrary
you
are
as
i
understand
richer
by
some
pounds
to
say
nothing
of
the
minute
knowledge
which
you
have
gained
on
every
subject
which
comes
under
the
letter
a
have
lost
nothing
by
them
sir
i
want
to
find
out
about
them
and
who
they
are
and
what
their
object
was
in
playing
this
prank
if
it
was
a
prank
upon
me
was
a
pretty
expensive
joke
for
them
for
it
cost
them
two
and
thirty
pounds
shall
endeavour
to
clear
up
these
points
for
you
first
one
or
two
questions
assistant
of
yours
who
first
called
your
attention
to
the
advertisement
how
long
had
he
been
with
you
a
month
then
did
he
come
answer
to
an
advertisement
he
the
only
applicant
i
had
a
dozen
did
you
pick
him
he
was
handy
and
would
come
cheap
half
wages
in
fact
is
he
like
this
stout
built
very
quick
in
his
ways
no
hair
on
his
face
though
he
s
not
short
of
thirty
a
white
splash
of
acid
upon
his
forehead
sat
up
in
his
chair
in
considerable
excitement
i
thought
as
much
said
he
you
ever
observed
that
his
ears
are
pierced
for
earrings
sir
told
me
that
a
gipsy
had
done
it
for
him
when
he
was
a
lad
said
sinking
back
in
deep
thought
is
still
with
you
yes
sir
i
have
only
just
left
him
has
your
business
been
attended
to
in
your
absence
to
complain
of
sir
s
never
very
much
to
do
of
a
morning
will
do
i
shall
be
happy
to
give
you
an
opinion
upon
the
subject
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
day
is
and
i
hope
that
by
we
may
come
to
a
conclusion
said
when
our
visitor
had
left
us
what
do
you
make
of
it
all
i
make
nothing
of
it
i
answered
frankly
is
a
most
mysterious
business
a
rule
said
the
more
bizarre
a
thing
is
the
less
mysterious
it
proves
to
be
is
your
commonplace
featureless
crimes
which
are
really
puzzling
just
as
a
commonplace
face
is
the
most
difficult
to
identify
i
must
be
prompt
over
this
matter
are
you
going
to
do
then
i
asked
smoke
he
answered
is
quite
a
three
pipe
problem
and
i
beg
that
you
won
t
speak
to
me
for
fifty
minutes
curled
himself
up
in
his
chair
with
his
thin
knees
drawn
up
to
his
hawk
like
nose
and
there
he
sat
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
black
clay
pipe
thrusting
out
like
the
bill
of
some
strange
bird
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
dropped
asleep
and
indeed
was
nodding
myself
when
he
suddenly
sprang
out
of
his
chair
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
who
has
made
up
his
mind
and
put
his
pipe
down
upon
the
mantelpiece
plays
at
the
s
this
afternoon
he
remarked
do
you
think
your
patients
spare
you
for
a
few
hours
i
have
nothing
to
do
to
day
practice
is
never
very
absorbing
put
on
your
hat
and
come
i
am
going
through
the
first
and
we
can
have
some
lunch
on
the
way
i
observe
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
music
on
the
programme
which
is
rather
more
to
my
taste
than
or
is
introspective
and
i
want
to
introspect
along
travelled
by
the
as
far
as
and
a
short
walk
took
us
to
the
scene
of
the
singular
story
which
we
had
listened
to
in
the
morning
was
a
poky
little
shabby
genteel
place
where
four
lines
of
dingy
two
storied
brick
houses
looked
out
into
a
small
railed
in
enclosure
where
a
lawn
of
weedy
grass
and
a
few
clumps
of
faded
laurel
bushes
made
a
hard
fight
against
a
smoke
laden
and
uncongenial
atmosphere
gilt
balls
and
a
brown
board
with
jabez
wilson
in
white
letters
upon
a
corner
house
announced
the
place
where
our
red
headed
client
carried
on
his
business
stopped
in
front
of
it
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
it
all
over
with
his
eyes
shining
brightly
between
puckered
lids
he
walked
slowly
up
the
street
and
then
down
again
to
the
corner
still
looking
keenly
at
the
houses
he
returned
to
the
pawnbroker
s
and
having
thumped
vigorously
upon
the
pavement
with
his
stick
two
or
three
times
he
went
up
to
the
door
and
knocked
was
instantly
opened
by
a
bright
looking
clean
shaven
young
fellow
who
asked
him
to
step
in
you
said
i
only
wished
to
ask
you
how
you
would
go
from
here
to
the
right
fourth
left
answered
the
assistant
promptly
closing
the
door
fellow
that
observed
as
we
walked
away
is
in
my
judgment
the
fourth
smartest
man
in
and
for
daring
i
am
not
sure
that
he
has
not
a
claim
to
be
third
i
have
known
something
of
him
before
said
i
s
assistant
counts
for
a
good
deal
in
this
mystery
of
the
headed
i
am
sure
that
you
inquired
your
way
merely
in
order
that
you
might
see
him
him
then
knees
of
his
trousers
what
did
you
see
i
expected
to
see

you

pavement
dear
doctor
this
is
a
time
for
observation
not
for
talk
are
spies
in
an
enemy
s
country
know
something
of
us
now
explore
the
parts
which
lie
behind
it
road
in
which
we
found
ourselves
as
we
turned
round
the
corner
from
the
retired
presented
as
great
a
contrast
to
it
as
the
front
of
a
picture
does
to
the
back
was
one
of
the
main
arteries
which
conveyed
the
traffic
of
the
to
the
north
and
west
roadway
was
blocked
with
the
immense
stream
of
commerce
flowing
in
a
double
tide
inward
and
outward
while
the
footpaths
were
black
with
the
hurrying
swarm
of
pedestrians
was
difficult
to
realise
as
we
looked
at
the
line
of
fine
shops
and
stately
business
premises
that
they
really
abutted
on
the
other
side
upon
the
faded
and
stagnant
square
which
we
had
just
quitted
me
see
said
standing
at
the
corner
and
glancing
along
the
line
i
should
like
just
to
remember
the
order
of
the
houses
here
is
a
hobby
of
mine
to
have
an
exact
knowledge
of
is
s
the
tobacconist
the
little
newspaper
shop

branch
of
the
and
the
and
s
carriage
building
depot
carries
us
right
on
to
the
other
block
now
we
ve
done
our
work
so
it
s
time
we
had
some
play
a
sandwich
and
a
cup
of
coffee
and
then
off
to
violin
land
where
all
is
sweetness
and
delicacy
and
harmony
and
there
are
no
red
headed
clients
to
vex
us
with
their
conundrums
friend
was
an
enthusiastic
musician
being
himself
not
only
a
very
capable
performer
but
a
composer
of
no
ordinary
merit
the
afternoon
he
sat
in
the
stalls
wrapped
in
the
most
perfect
happiness
gently
waving
his
long
thin
fingers
in
time
to
the
music
while
his
gently
smiling
face
and
his
languid
dreamy
eyes
were
as
unlike
those
of
the
sleuth
hound
the
relentless
keen
witted
ready
handed
criminal
agent
as
it
was
possible
to
conceive
his
singular
character
the
dual
nature
alternately
asserted
itself
and
his
extreme
exactness
and
astuteness
represented
as
i
have
often
thought
the
reaction
against
the
poetic
and
contemplative
mood
which
occasionally
predominated
in
him
swing
of
his
nature
took
him
from
extreme
languor
to
devouring
energy
and
as
i
knew
well
he
was
never
so
truly
formidable
as
when
for
days
on
end
he
had
been
lounging
in
his
armchair
amid
his
improvisations
and
his
black
letter
editions
it
was
that
the
lust
of
the
chase
would
suddenly
come
upon
him
and
that
his
brilliant
reasoning
power
would
rise
to
the
level
of
intuition
until
those
who
were
unacquainted
with
his
methods
would
look
askance
at
him
as
on
a
man
whose
knowledge
was
not
that
of
other
mortals
i
saw
him
that
afternoon
so
enwrapped
in
the
music
at
s
i
felt
that
an
evil
time
might
be
coming
upon
those
whom
he
had
set
himself
to
hunt
down
want
to
go
home
no
doubt
he
remarked
as
we
emerged
it
would
be
as
well
i
have
some
business
to
do
which
will
take
some
hours
business
at
is
serious
serious
a
considerable
crime
is
in
contemplation
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
we
shall
be
in
time
to
stop
it
to
day
being
rather
complicates
matters
i
shall
want
your
help
to
night
what
time
will
be
early
enough
i
shall
be
at
at
ten
well
i
say
there
may
be
some
little
danger
so
kindly
put
your
army
revolver
in
your
pocket
waved
his
hand
turned
on
his
heel
and
disappeared
in
an
instant
among
the
crowd
i
trust
that
i
am
not
more
dense
than
my
neighbours
but
i
was
always
oppressed
with
a
sense
of
my
own
stupidity
in
my
dealings
with
i
had
heard
what
he
had
heard
i
had
seen
what
he
had
seen
and
yet
from
his
words
it
was
evident
that
he
saw
clearly
not
only
what
had
happened
but
what
was
about
to
happen
while
to
me
the
whole
business
was
still
confused
and
grotesque
i
drove
home
to
my
house
in
i
thought
over
it
all
from
the
extraordinary
story
of
the
red
headed
copier
of
the
down
to
the
visit
to
and
the
ominous
words
with
which
he
had
parted
from
me
was
this
nocturnal
expedition
and
why
should
i
go
armed
were
we
going
and
what
were
we
to
do
i
had
the
hint
from
that
this
smooth
faced
pawnbroker
s
assistant
was
a
formidable
man
a
man
who
might
play
a
deep
game
i
tried
to
puzzle
it
out
but
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
set
the
matter
aside
until
night
should
bring
an
explanation
was
a
quarter
past
nine
when
i
started
from
home
and
made
my
way
across
the
and
so
through
to
hansoms
were
standing
at
the
door
and
as
i
entered
the
passage
i
heard
the
sound
of
voices
from
above
entering
his
room
i
found
in
animated
conversation
with
two
men
one
of
whom
i
recognised
as
the
official
police
agent
while
the
other
was
a
long
thin
sad
faced
man
with
a
very
shiny
hat
and
oppressively
respectable
frock
coat
party
is
complete
said
buttoning
up
his
pea
jacket
and
taking
his
heavy
hunting
crop
from
the
rack
i
think
you
know
of
me
introduce
you
to
who
is
to
be
our
companion
in
to
night
s
adventure
re
hunting
in
couples
again
you
see
said
in
his
consequential
way
friend
here
is
a
wonderful
man
for
starting
a
chase
he
wants
is
an
old
dog
to
help
him
to
do
the
running
down
i
hope
a
wild
goose
may
not
prove
to
be
the
end
of
our
chase
observed
gloomily
may
place
considerable
confidence
in
sir
said
the
police
agent
loftily
has
his
own
little
methods
which
are
if
he
won
t
mind
my
saying
so
just
a
little
too
theoretical
and
fantastic
but
he
has
the
makings
of
a
detective
in
him
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
once
or
twice
as
in
that
business
of
the
murder
and
the
treasure
he
has
been
more
nearly
correct
than
the
official
force
if
you
say
so
it
is
all
right
said
the
stranger
with
deference
i
confess
that
i
miss
my
rubber
is
the
first
night
for
seven
and
twenty
years
that
i
have
not
had
my
rubber
i
think
you
will
find
said
that
you
will
play
for
a
higher
stake
to
night
than
you
have
ever
done
yet
and
that
the
play
will
be
more
exciting
you
the
stake
will
be
some
pounds
and
for
you
it
will
be
the
man
upon
whom
you
wish
to
lay
your
hands
the
murderer
thief
smasher
and
forger
s
a
young
man
but
he
is
at
the
head
of
his
profession
and
i
would
rather
have
my
bracelets
on
him
than
on
any
criminal
in
s
a
remarkable
man
is
young
grandfather
was
a
royal
duke
and
he
himself
has
been
to
and
brain
is
as
cunning
as
his
fingers
and
though
we
meet
signs
of
him
at
every
turn
we
never
know
where
to
find
the
man
himself
ll
crack
a
crib
in
one
week
and
be
raising
money
to
build
an
orphanage
in
the
next
i
ve
been
on
his
track
for
years
and
have
never
set
eyes
on
him
yet
i
hope
that
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
you
to
night
i
ve
had
one
or
two
little
turns
also
with
and
i
agree
with
you
that
he
is
at
the
head
of
his
profession
is
past
ten
however
and
quite
time
that
we

take
the
first

second

not
very
communicative
during
the
long
drive
and
lay
back
in
the
cab
humming
the
tunes
which
he
had
heard
in
the
afternoon
rattled
through
an
endless
labyrinth
of
gas
lit
streets
until
we
emerged
into
are
close
there
now
my
friend
remarked
fellow
is
a
bank
director
and
personally
interested
in
the
matter
i
thought
it
as
well
to
have
with
us
also
is
not
a
bad
fellow
though
an
absolute
imbecile
in
his
profession
has
one
positive
virtue
is
as
brave
as
a
bulldog
and
as
tenacious
as
a
lobster
if
he
gets
his
claws
upon
anyone
we
are
and
they
are
waiting
for
us
had
reached
the
same
crowded
thoroughfare
in
which
we
had
found
ourselves
in
the
morning
cabs
were
dismissed
and
following
the
guidance
of
we
passed
down
a
narrow
passage
and
through
a
side
door
which
he
opened
for
us
there
was
a
small
corridor
which
ended
in
a
very
massive
iron
gate
also
was
opened
and
led
down
a
flight
of
winding
stone
steps
which
terminated
at
another
formidable
gate
stopped
to
light
a
lantern
and
then
conducted
us
down
a
dark
earth
smelling
passage
and
so
after
opening
a
third
door
into
a
huge
vault
or
cellar
which
was
piled
all
round
with
crates
and
massive
boxes
are
not
very
vulnerable
from
above
remarked
as
he
held
up
the
lantern
and
gazed
about
him
from
below
said
striking
his
stick
upon
the
flags
which
lined
the
floor
dear
me
it
sounds
quite
hollow
he
remarked
looking
up
in
surprise
i
must
really
ask
you
to
be
a
little
more
quiet
said
severely
have
already
imperilled
the
whole
success
of
our
expedition
i
beg
that
you
would
have
the
goodness
to
sit
down
upon
one
of
those
boxes
and
not
to
interfere
solemn
perched
himself
upon
a
crate
with
a
very
injured
expression
upon
his
face
while
fell
upon
his
knees
upon
the
floor
and
with
the
lantern
and
a
magnifying
lens
began
to
examine
minutely
the
cracks
between
the
stones
a
few
seconds
sufficed
to
satisfy
him
for
he
sprang
to
his
feet
again
and
put
his
glass
in
his
pocket
have
at
least
an
hour
before
us
he
remarked
for
they
can
hardly
take
any
steps
until
the
good
pawnbroker
is
safely
in
bed
they
will
not
lose
a
minute
for
the
sooner
they
do
their
work
the
longer
time
they
will
have
for
their
escape
are
at
present
as
no
doubt
you
have
divined
in
the
cellar
of
the
branch
of
one
of
the
principal
banks
is
the
chairman
of
directors
and
he
will
explain
to
you
that
there
are
reasons
why
the
more
daring
criminals
of
should
take
a
considerable
interest
in
this
cellar
at
present
is
our
gold
whispered
the
director
have
had
several
warnings
that
an
attempt
might
be
made
upon
it
gold
had
occasion
some
months
ago
to
strengthen
our
resources
and
borrowed
for
that
purpose
napoleons
from
the
of
has
become
known
that
we
have
never
had
occasion
to
unpack
the
money
and
that
it
is
still
lying
in
our
cellar
crate
upon
which
i
sit
contains
napoleons
packed
between
layers
of
lead
foil
reserve
of
bullion
is
much
larger
at
present
than
is
usually
kept
in
a
single
branch
office
and
the
directors
have
had
misgivings
upon
the
subject
were
very
well
justified
observed
now
it
is
time
that
we
arranged
our
little
plans
i
expect
that
within
an
hour
matters
will
come
to
a
head
the
meantime
we
must
put
the
screen
over
that
dark
lantern
sit
in
the
dark
i
am
afraid
so
i
had
brought
a
pack
of
cards
in
my
pocket
and
i
thought
that
as
we
were
a
partie
carr
e
you
might
have
your
rubber
after
all
i
see
that
the
enemy
s
preparations
have
gone
so
far
that
we
cannot
risk
the
presence
of
a
light
first
of
all
we
must
choose
our
positions
are
daring
men
and
though
we
shall
take
them
at
a
disadvantage
they
may
do
us
some
harm
unless
we
are
careful
i
shall
stand
behind
this
crate
and
do
you
conceal
yourselves
behind
those
when
i
flash
a
light
upon
them
close
in
swiftly
they
fire
have
no
compunction
about
shooting
them
down
i
placed
my
revolver
cocked
upon
the
top
of
the
wooden
case
behind
which
i
crouched
shot
the
slide
across
the
front
of
his
lantern
and
left
us
in
pitch
darkness
such
an
absolute
darkness
as
i
have
never
before
experienced
smell
of
hot
metal
remained
to
assure
us
that
the
light
was
still
there
ready
to
flash
out
at
a
moment
s
notice
me
with
my
nerves
worked
up
to
a
pitch
of
expectancy
there
was
something
depressing
and
subduing
in
the
sudden
gloom
and
in
the
cold
dank
air
of
the
vault
have
but
one
retreat
whispered
is
back
through
the
house
into
i
hope
that
you
have
done
what
i
asked
you
i
have
an
inspector
and
two
officers
waiting
at
the
front
door
we
have
stopped
all
the
holes
now
we
must
be
silent
and
wait
a
time
it
seemed
comparing
notes
afterwards
it
was
but
an
hour
and
a
quarter
yet
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
night
must
have
almost
gone
and
the
dawn
be
breaking
above
us
limbs
were
weary
and
stiff
for
i
feared
to
change
my
position
yet
my
nerves
were
worked
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
tension
and
my
hearing
was
so
acute
that
i
could
not
only
hear
the
gentle
breathing
of
my
companions
but
i
could
distinguish
the
deeper
heavier
in
breath
of
the
bulky
from
the
thin
sighing
note
of
the
bank
director
my
position
i
could
look
over
the
case
in
the
direction
of
the
floor
my
eyes
caught
the
glint
of
a
light
first
it
was
but
a
lurid
spark
upon
the
stone
pavement
it
lengthened
out
until
it
became
a
yellow
line
and
then
without
any
warning
or
sound
a
gash
seemed
to
open
and
a
hand
appeared
a
white
almost
womanly
hand
which
felt
about
in
the
centre
of
the
little
area
of
light
a
minute
or
more
the
hand
with
its
writhing
fingers
protruded
out
of
the
floor
it
was
withdrawn
as
suddenly
as
it
appeared
and
all
was
dark
again
save
the
single
lurid
spark
which
marked
a
chink
between
the
stones
disappearance
however
was
but
momentary
a
rending
tearing
sound
one
of
the
broad
white
stones
turned
over
upon
its
side
and
left
a
square
gaping
hole
through
which
streamed
the
light
of
a
lantern
the
edge
there
peeped
a
clean
cut
boyish
face
which
looked
keenly
about
it
and
then
with
a
hand
on
either
side
of
the
aperture
drew
itself
shoulder
high
and
waist
high
until
one
knee
rested
upon
the
edge
another
instant
he
stood
at
the
side
of
the
hole
and
was
hauling
after
him
a
companion
lithe
and
small
like
himself
with
a
pale
face
and
a
shock
of
very
red
hair
s
all
clear
he
whispered
you
the
chisel
and
the
bags
jump
and
i
ll
swing
for
it
had
sprung
out
and
seized
the
intruder
by
the
collar
other
dived
down
the
hole
and
i
heard
the
sound
of
rending
cloth
as
clutched
at
his
skirts
light
flashed
upon
the
barrel
of
a
revolver
but
hunting
crop
came
down
on
the
man
s
wrist
and
the
pistol
clinked
upon
the
stone
floor
s
no
use
said
blandly
have
no
chance
at
all
i
see
the
other
answered
with
the
utmost
coolness
i
fancy
that
my
pal
is
all
right
though
i
see
you
have
got
his
coat
tails
are
three
men
waiting
for
him
at
the
door
said
indeed
seem
to
have
done
the
thing
very
completely
i
must
compliment
you
i
you
answered
red
headed
idea
was
very
new
and
effective
ll
see
your
pal
again
presently
said
s
quicker
at
climbing
down
holes
than
i
am
hold
out
while
i
fix
the
derbies
i
beg
that
you
will
not
touch
me
with
your
filthy
hands
remarked
our
prisoner
as
the
handcuffs
clattered
upon
his
wrists
may
not
be
aware
that
i
have
royal
blood
in
my
veins
the
goodness
also
when
you
address
me
always
to
say
sir
and
please
right
said
with
a
stare
and
a
snigger
would
you
please
sir
march
upstairs
where
we
can
get
a
cab
to
carry
your
to
the
police
station
is
better
said
serenely
made
a
sweeping
bow
to
the
three
of
us
and
walked
quietly
off
in
the
custody
of
the
detective
said
as
we
followed
them
from
the
cellar
i
do
not
know
how
the
bank
can
thank
you
or
repay
you
is
no
doubt
that
you
have
detected
and
defeated
in
the
most
complete
manner
one
of
the
most
determined
attempts
at
bank
robbery
that
have
ever
come
within
my
experience
i
have
had
one
or
two
little
scores
of
my
own
to
settle
with
said
i
have
been
at
some
small
expense
over
this
matter
which
i
shall
expect
the
bank
to
refund
but
beyond
that
i
am
amply
repaid
by
having
had
an
experience
which
is
in
many
ways
unique
and
by
hearing
the
very
remarkable
narrative
of
the
headed
see
he
explained
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
as
we
sat
over
a
glass
of
whisky
and
soda
in
it
was
perfectly
obvious
from
the
first
that
the
only
possible
object
of
this
rather
fantastic
business
of
the
advertisement
of
the
and
the
copying
of
the
must
be
to
get
this
not
over
bright
pawnbroker
out
of
the
way
for
a
number
of
hours
every
day
was
a
curious
way
of
managing
it
but
really
it
would
be
difficult
to
suggest
a
better
method
was
no
doubt
suggested
to
s
ingenious
mind
by
the
colour
of
his
accomplice
s
hair
pounds
a
week
was
a
lure
which
must
draw
him
and
what
was
it
to
them
who
were
playing
for
thousands
put
in
the
advertisement
one
rogue
has
the
temporary
office
the
other
rogue
incites
the
man
to
apply
for
it
and
together
they
manage
to
secure
his
absence
every
morning
in
the
week
the
time
that
i
heard
of
the
assistant
having
come
for
half
wages
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
he
had
some
strong
motive
for
securing
the
situation
how
could
you
guess
what
the
motive
was
there
been
women
in
the
house
i
should
have
suspected
a
mere
vulgar
intrigue
however
was
out
of
the
question
man
s
business
was
a
small
one
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
house
which
could
account
for
such
elaborate
preparations
and
such
an
expenditure
as
they
were
at
must
then
be
something
out
of
the
house
could
it
be
i
thought
of
the
assistant
s
fondness
for
photography
and
his
trick
of
vanishing
into
the
cellar
cellar
was
the
end
of
this
tangled
clue
i
made
inquiries
as
to
this
mysterious
assistant
and
found
that
i
had
to
deal
with
one
of
the
coolest
and
most
daring
criminals
in
was
doing
something
in
the
cellar
something
which
took
many
hours
a
day
for
months
on
end
could
it
be
once
more
i
could
think
of
nothing
save
that
he
was
running
a
tunnel
to
some
other
building
far
i
had
got
when
we
went
to
visit
the
scene
of
action
i
surprised
you
by
beating
upon
the
pavement
with
my
stick
i
was
ascertaining
whether
the
cellar
stretched
out
in
front
or
behind
was
not
in
front
i
rang
the
bell
and
as
i
hoped
the
assistant
answered
it
have
had
some
skirmishes
but
we
had
never
set
eyes
upon
each
other
before
i
hardly
looked
at
his
face
knees
were
what
i
wished
to
see
must
yourself
have
remarked
how
worn
wrinkled
and
stained
they
were
spoke
of
those
hours
of
burrowing
only
remaining
point
was
what
they
were
burrowing
for
i
walked
round
the
corner
saw
the
and
abutted
on
our
friend
s
premises
and
felt
that
i
had
solved
my
problem
you
drove
home
after
the
concert
i
called
upon
and
upon
the
chairman
of
the
bank
directors
with
the
result
that
you
have
seen
how
could
you
tell
that
they
would
make
their
attempt
to
night
i
asked
when
they
closed
their
offices
that
was
a
sign
that
they
cared
no
longer
about
s
presence
in
other
words
that
they
had
completed
their
tunnel
it
was
essential
that
they
should
use
it
soon
as
it
might
be
discovered
or
the
bullion
might
be
removed
would
suit
them
better
than
any
other
day
as
it
would
give
them
two
days
for
their
escape
all
these
reasons
i
expected
them
to
come
to
night
reasoned
it
out
beautifully
i
exclaimed
in
unfeigned
admiration
is
so
long
a
chain
and
yet
every
link
rings
true
saved
me
from
ennui
he
answered
yawning
i
already
feel
it
closing
in
upon
me
life
is
spent
in
one
long
effort
to
escape
from
the
commonplaces
of
existence
little
problems
help
me
to
do
so
you
are
a
benefactor
of
the
race
said
i
shrugged
his
shoulders
perhaps
after
all
it
is
of
some
little
use
he
remarked

dear
fellow
said

we
sat
on
either
side
of
the
fire
in
his
lodgings
at

stranger
than
anything

the

conceive

things

are

could
fly
out
of
that
window
hand
in
hand
hover
over
this
great
city
gently
remove
the
roofs
and
peep
in
at
the
queer
things
which
are
going
on
the
strange
coincidences
the
plannings
the
cross
purposes
the
wonderful
chains
of
events
working
through
generations
and
leading
to
the

it
would
make
all
fiction
with
its
conventionalities
and
foreseen
conclusions
most
stale
and
unprofitable
yet
i
am
not
convinced
of
it
i
answered
cases
which
come
to
light
in
the
papers
are
as
a
rule
bald
enough
and
vulgar
enough
have
in
our
police
reports
realism
pushed
to
its
extreme
limits
and
yet
the
result
is
it
must
be
confessed
neither
fascinating
nor
artistic
a
certain
selection
and
discretion
must
be
used
in
producing
a
realistic
effect
remarked
is
wanting
in
the
police
report
where
more
stress
is
laid
perhaps
upon
the
platitudes
of
the
magistrate
than
upon
the
details
which
to
an
observer
contain
the
vital
essence
of
the
whole
matter
upon
it
there
is
nothing
so
unnatural
as
the
commonplace
i
smiled
and
shook
my
head
i
can
quite
understand
your
thinking
so
i
said
course
in
your
position
of
unofficial
adviser
and
helper
to
everybody
who
is
absolutely
puzzled
throughout
three
continents
you
are
brought
in
contact
with
all
that
is
strange
and
bizarre
here
i
picked
up
the
morning
paper
from
the
ground
let
us
put
it
to
a
practical
test
is
the
first
heading
upon
which
i
come
a
husband
s
cruelty
to
his
wife
is
half
a
column
of
print
but
i
know
without
reading
it
that
it
is
all
perfectly
familiar
to
me
is
of
course
the
other
woman
the
drink
the
push
the
blow
the
bruise
the
sympathetic
sister
or
landlady
crudest
of
writers
could
invent
nothing
more
crude
your
example
is
an
unfortunate
one
for
your
argument
said
taking
the
paper
and
glancing
his
eye
down
it
is
the
separation
case
and
as
it
happens
i
was
engaged
in
clearing
up
some
small
points
in
connection
with
it
husband
was
a
teetotaler
there
was
no
other
woman
and
the
conduct
complained
of
was
that
he
had
drifted
into
the
habit
of
winding
up
every
meal
by
taking
out
his
false
teeth
and
hurling
them
at
his
wife
which
you
will
allow
is
not
an
action
likely
to
occur
to
the
imagination
of
the
average
story
teller
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
acknowledge
that
i
have
scored
over
you
in
your
example
held
out
his
snuffbox
of
old
gold
with
a
great
amethyst
in
the
centre
of
the
lid
splendour
was
in
such
contrast
to
his
homely
ways
and
simple
life
that
i
could
not
help
commenting
upon
it
said
he
i
forgot
that
i
had
not
seen
you
for
some
weeks
is
a
little
souvenir
from
the
of
in
return
for
my
assistance
in
the
case
of
the
papers
the
ring
i
asked
glancing
at
a
remarkable
brilliant
which
sparkled
upon
his
finger
was
from
the
reigning
family
of
though
the
matter
in
which
i
served
them
was
of
such
delicacy
that
i
cannot
confide
it
even
to
you
who
have
been
good
enough
to
chronicle
one
or
two
of
my
little
problems
have
you
any
on
hand
just
now
i
asked
with
interest
ten
or
twelve
but
none
which
present
any
feature
of
interest
are
important
you
understand
without
being
interesting
i
have
found
that
it
is
usually
in
unimportant
matters
that
there
is
a
field
for
the
observation
and
for
the
quick
analysis
of
cause
and
effect
which
gives
the
charm
to
an
investigation
larger
crimes
are
apt
to
be
the
simpler
for
the
bigger
the
crime
the
more
obvious
as
a
rule
is
the
motive
these
cases
save
for
one
rather
intricate
matter
which
has
been
referred
to
me
from
there
is
nothing
which
presents
any
features
of
interest
is
possible
however
that
i
may
have
something
better
before
very
many
minutes
are
over
for
this
is
one
of
my
clients
or
i
am
much
mistaken
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
was
standing
between
the
parted
blinds
gazing
down
into
the
dull
neutral
tinted
street
over
his
shoulder
i
saw
that
on
the
pavement
opposite
there
stood
a
large
woman
with
a
heavy
fur
boa
round
her
neck
and
a
large
curling
red
feather
in
a
broad
brimmed
hat
which
was
tilted
in
a
coquettish
of
fashion
over
her
ear
under
this
great
panoply
she
peeped
up
in
a
nervous
hesitating
fashion
at
our
windows
while
her
body
oscillated
backward
and
forward
and
her
fingers
fidgeted
with
her
glove
buttons
with
a
plunge
as
of
the
swimmer
who
leaves
the
bank
she
hurried
across
the
road
and
we
heard
the
sharp
clang
of
the
bell
i
have
seen
those
symptoms
before
said
throwing
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
upon
the
pavement
always
means
an
affaire
de
coeur
would
like
advice
but
is
not
sure
that
the
matter
is
not
too
delicate
for
communication
yet
even
here
we
may
discriminate
a
woman
has
been
seriously
wronged
by
a
man
she
no
longer
oscillates
and
the
usual
symptom
is
a
broken
bell
wire
we
may
take
it
that
there
is
a
love
matter
but
that
the
maiden
is
not
so
much
angry
as
perplexed
or
grieved
here
she
comes
in
person
to
resolve
our
doubts
he
spoke
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
the
boy
in
buttons
entered
to
announce
while
the
lady
herself
loomed
behind
his
small
black
figure
like
a
full
sailed
merchant
man
behind
a
tiny
pilot
boat
welcomed
her
with
the
easy
courtesy
for
which
he
was
remarkable
and
having
closed
the
door
and
bowed
her
into
an
armchair
he
looked
her
over
in
the
minute
and
yet
abstracted
fashion
which
was
peculiar
to
him
you
not
find
he
said
that
with
your
short
sight
it
is
a
little
trying
to
do
so
much
typewriting
i
did
at
first
she
answered
but
now
i
know
where
the
letters
are
without
looking
suddenly
realising
the
full
purport
of
his
words
she
gave
a
violent
start
and
looked
up
with
fear
and
astonishment
upon
her
broad
good
humoured
face
ve
heard
about
me
she
cried
else
how
could
you
know
all
that
mind
said
laughing
it
is
my
business
to
know
things
i
have
trained
myself
to
see
what
others
overlook
not
why
should
you
come
to
consult
me
i
came
to
you
sir
because
i
heard
of
you
from
whose
husband
you
found
so
easy
when
the
police
and
everyone
had
given
him
up
for
dead
i
wish
you
would
do
as
much
for
me
i
m
not
rich
but
still
i
have
a
hundred
a
year
in
my
own
right
besides
the
little
that
i
make
by
the
machine
and
i
would
give
it
all
to
know
what
has
become
of
did
you
come
away
to
consult
me
in
such
a
hurry
asked
with
his
finger
tips
together
and
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
a
startled
look
came
over
the
somewhat
vacuous
face
of
i
did
bang
out
of
the
house
she
said
for
it
made
me
angry
to
see
the
easy
way
in
which
that
is
my
father
took
it
all
would
not
go
to
the
police
and
he
would
not
go
to
you
and
so
at
last
as
he
would
do
nothing
and
kept
on
saying
that
there
was
no
harm
done
it
made
me
mad
and
i
just
on
with
my
things
and
came
right
away
to
you
father
said
your
stepfather
surely
since
the
name
is
different
my
stepfather
i
call
him
father
though
it
sounds
funny
too
for
he
is
only
five
years
and
two
months
older
than
myself
your
mother
is
alive
yes
mother
is
alive
and
well
i
wasn
t
best
pleased
when
she
married
again
so
soon
after
father
s
death
and
a
man
who
was
nearly
fifteen
years
younger
than
herself
was
a
plumber
in
the
and
he
left
a
tidy
business
behind
him
which
mother
carried
on
with
the
foreman
but
when
came
he
made
her
sell
the
business
for
he
was
very
superior
being
a
traveller
in
wines
got
pounds
for
the
goodwill
and
interest
which
wasn
t
near
as
much
as
father
could
have
got
if
he
had
been
alive
i
had
expected
to
see
impatient
under
this
rambling
and
inconsequential
narrative
but
on
the
contrary
he
had
listened
with
the
greatest
concentration
of
attention
own
little
income
he
asked
does
it
come
out
of
the
business
no
sir
is
quite
separate
and
was
left
me
by
my
uncle
in
is
in
stock
paying
per
cent
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
was
the
amount
but
i
can
only
touch
the
interest
interest
me
extremely
said
since
you
draw
so
large
a
sum
as
a
hundred
a
year
with
what
you
earn
into
the
bargain
you
no
doubt
travel
a
little
and
indulge
yourself
in
every
way
i
believe
that
a
single
lady
can
get
on
very
nicely
upon
an
income
of
about
pounds
i
could
do
with
much
less
than
that
but
you
understand
that
as
long
as
i
live
at
home
i
don
t
wish
to
be
a
burden
to
them
and
so
they
have
the
use
of
the
money
just
while
i
am
staying
with
them
course
that
is
only
just
for
the
time
draws
my
interest
every
quarter
and
pays
it
over
to
mother
and
i
find
that
i
can
do
pretty
well
with
what
i
earn
at
typewriting
brings
me
twopence
a
sheet
and
i
can
often
do
from
fifteen
to
twenty
sheets
in
a
day
have
made
your
position
very
clear
to
me
said
is
my
friend
before
whom
you
can
speak
as
freely
as
before
myself
tell
us
now
all
about
your
connection
with
a
flush
stole
over
s
face
and
she
picked
nervously
at
the
fringe
of
her
jacket
i
met
him
first
at
the
gasfitters
ball
she
said
used
to
send
father
tickets
when
he
was
alive
and
then
afterwards
they
remembered
us
and
sent
them
to
mother
did
not
wish
us
to
go
never
did
wish
us
to
go
anywhere
would
get
quite
mad
if
i
wanted
so
much
as
to
join
a
school
treat
this
time
i
was
set
on
going
and
i
would
go
for
what
right
had
he
to
prevent
said
the
folk
were
not
fit
for
us
to
know
when
all
father
s
friends
were
to
be
there
he
said
that
i
had
nothing
fit
to
wear
when
i
had
my
purple
plush
that
i
had
never
so
much
as
taken
out
of
the
drawer
last
when
nothing
else
would
do
he
went
off
to
upon
the
business
of
the
firm
but
we
went
mother
and
i
with
who
used
to
be
our
foreman
and
it
was
there
i
met
i
suppose
said
that
when
came
back
from
he
was
very
annoyed
at
your
having
gone
to
the
ball
well
he
was
very
good
about
it
laughed
i
remember
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
there
was
no
use
denying
anything
to
a
woman
for
she
would
have
her
way
i
see
at
the
gasfitters
ball
you
met
as
i
understand
a
gentleman
called
sir
i
met
him
that
night
and
he
called
next
day
to
ask
if
we
had
got
home
all
safe
and
after
that
we
met
him
that
is
to
say
i
met
him
twice
for
walks
but
after
that
father
came
back
again
and
could
not
come
to
the
house
any
more
you
know
father
didn
t
like
anything
of
the
sort
wouldn
t
have
any
visitors
if
he
could
help
it
and
he
used
to
say
that
a
woman
should
be
happy
in
her
own
family
circle
then
as
i
used
to
say
to
mother
a
woman
wants
her
own
circle
to
begin
with
and
i
had
not
got
mine
yet
how
about
he
make
no
attempt
to
see
you
father
was
going
off
to
again
in
a
week
and
wrote
and
said
that
it
would
be
safer
and
better
not
to
see
each
other
until
he
had
gone
could
write
in
the
meantime
and
he
used
to
write
every
day
i
took
the
letters
in
in
the
morning
so
there
was
no
need
for
father
to
know
you
engaged
to
the
gentleman
at
this
time
yes
were
engaged
after
the
first
walk
that
we
took
was
a
cashier
in
an
office
in
and
office
s
the
worst
of
it
i
don
t
know
did
he
live
then
slept
on
the
premises
you
don
t
know
his
address
except
that
it
was
did
you
address
your
letters
then
the
to
be
left
till
called
for
said
that
if
they
were
sent
to
the
office
he
would
be
chaffed
by
all
the
other
clerks
about
having
letters
from
a
lady
so
i
offered
to
typewrite
them
like
he
did
his
but
he
wouldn
t
have
that
for
he
said
that
when
i
wrote
them
they
seemed
to
come
from
me
but
when
they
were
typewritten
he
always
felt
that
the
machine
had
come
between
us
will
just
show
you
how
fond
he
was
of
me
and
the
little
things
that
he
would
think
of
was
most
suggestive
said
has
long
been
an
axiom
of
mine
that
the
little
things
are
infinitely
the
most
important
you
remember
any
other
little
things
about
was
a
very
shy
man
would
rather
walk
with
me
in
the
evening
than
in
the
daylight
for
he
said
that
he
hated
to
be
conspicuous
retiring
and
gentlemanly
he
was
his
voice
was
gentle
d
had
the
quinsy
and
swollen
glands
when
he
was
young
he
told
me
and
it
had
left
him
with
a
weak
throat
and
a
hesitating
whispering
fashion
of
speech
was
always
well
dressed
very
neat
and
plain
but
his
eyes
were
weak
just
as
mine
are
and
he
wore
tinted
glasses
against
the
glare
and
what
happened
when
your
stepfather
returned
to
came
to
the
house
again
and
proposed
that
we
should
marry
before
father
came
back
was
in
dreadful
earnest
and
made
me
swear
with
my
hands
on
the
that
whatever
happened
i
would
always
be
true
to
him
said
he
was
quite
right
to
make
me
swear
and
that
it
was
a
sign
of
his
passion
was
all
in
his
favour
from
the
first
and
was
even
fonder
of
him
than
i
was
when
they
talked
of
marrying
within
the
week
i
began
to
ask
about
father
but
they
both
said
never
to
mind
about
father
but
just
to
tell
him
afterwards
and
mother
said
she
would
make
it
all
right
with
him
i
didn
t
quite
like
that
seemed
funny
that
i
should
ask
his
leave
as
he
was
only
a
few
years
older
than
me
but
i
didn
t
want
to
do
anything
on
the
sly
so
i
wrote
to
father
at
where
the
company
has
its
offices
but
the
letter
came
back
to
me
on
the
very
morning
of
the
wedding
missed
him
then
sir
for
he
had
started
to
just
before
it
arrived
that
was
unfortunate
wedding
was
arranged
then
for
the
it
to
be
in
church
sir
but
very
quietly
was
to
be
at
s
near
s
and
we
were
to
have
breakfast
afterwards
at
the
came
for
us
in
a
hansom
but
as
there
were
two
of
us
he
put
us
both
into
it
and
stepped
himself
into
a
four
wheeler
which
happened
to
be
the
only
other
cab
in
the
street
got
to
the
church
first
and
when
the
four
wheeler
drove
up
we
waited
for
him
to
step
out
but
he
never
did
and
when
the
cabman
got
down
from
the
box
and
looked
there
was
no
one
there
cabman
said
that
he
could
not
imagine
what
had
become
of
him
for
he
had
seen
him
get
in
with
his
own
eyes
was
last
and
i
have
never
seen
or
heard
anything
since
then
to
throw
any
light
upon
what
became
of
him
seems
to
me
that
you
have
been
very
shamefully
treated
said
no
sir
was
too
good
and
kind
to
leave
me
so
all
the
morning
he
was
saying
to
me
that
whatever
happened
i
was
to
be
true
and
that
even
if
something
quite
unforeseen
occurred
to
separate
us
i
was
always
to
remember
that
i
was
pledged
to
him
and
that
he
would
claim
his
pledge
sooner
or
later
seemed
strange
talk
for
a
wedding
morning
but
what
has
happened
since
gives
a
meaning
to
it
certainly
it
does
own
opinion
is
then
that
some
unforeseen
catastrophe
has
occurred
to
him
sir
i
believe
that
he
foresaw
some
danger
or
else
he
would
not
have
talked
so
then
i
think
that
what
he
foresaw
happened
you
have
no
notion
as
to
what
it
could
have
been
more
question
did
your
mother
take
the
matter
was
angry
and
said
that
i
was
never
to
speak
of
the
matter
again
your
father
you
tell
him
and
he
seemed
to
think
with
me
that
something
had
happened
and
that
i
should
hear
of
again
he
said
what
interest
could
anyone
have
in
bringing
me
to
the
doors
of
the
church
and
then
leaving
me
if
he
had
borrowed
my
money
or
if
he
had
married
me
and
got
my
money
settled
on
him
there
might
be
some
reason
but
was
very
independent
about
money
and
never
would
look
at
a
shilling
of
mine
yet
what
could
have
happened
why
could
he
not
write
it
drives
me
half
mad
to
think
of
it
and
i
can
t
sleep
a
wink
at
night
pulled
a
little
handkerchief
out
of
her
muff
and
began
to
sob
heavily
into
it
i
shall
glance
into
the
case
for
you
said
rising
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
we
shall
reach
some
definite
result
the
weight
of
the
matter
rest
upon
me
now
and
do
not
let
your
mind
dwell
upon
it
further
all
try
to
let
vanish
from
your
memory
as
he
has
done
from
your
life
you
don
t
think
i
ll
see
him
again
i
fear
not
what
has
happened
to
him
will
leave
that
question
in
my
hands
i
should
like
an
accurate
description
of
him
and
any
letters
of
his
which
you
can
spare
i
advertised
for
him
in
last
s
said
she
is
the
slip
and
here
are
four
letters
from
him
you
your
address
s
address
you
never
had
i
understand
is
your
father
s
place
of
business
travels
for
the
great
claret
importers
of
you
have
made
your
statement
very
clearly
will
leave
the
papers
here
and
remember
the
advice
which
i
have
given
you
the
whole
incident
be
a
sealed
book
and
do
not
allow
it
to
affect
your
life
are
very
kind
but
i
cannot
do
that
i
shall
be
true
to
shall
find
me
ready
when
he
comes
back
all
the
preposterous
hat
and
the
vacuous
face
there
was
something
noble
in
the
simple
faith
of
our
visitor
which
compelled
our
respect
laid
her
little
bundle
of
papers
upon
the
table
and
went
her
way
with
a
promise
to
come
again
whenever
she
might
be
summoned
sat
silent
for
a
few
minutes
with
his
fingertips
still
pressed
together
his
legs
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
and
his
gaze
directed
upward
to
the
ceiling
he
took
down
from
the
rack
the
old
and
oily
clay
pipe
which
was
to
him
as
a
counsellor
and
having
lit
it
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
the
thick
blue
cloud
wreaths
spinning
up
from
him
and
a
look
of
infinite
languor
in
his
face
an
interesting
study
that
maiden
he
observed
i
found
her
more
interesting
than
her
little
problem
which
by
the
way
is
rather
a
trite
one
will
find
parallel
cases
if
you
consult
my
index
in
in
and
there
was
something
of
the
sort
at
last
year
as
is
the
idea
however
there
were
one
or
two
details
which
were
new
to
me
the
maiden
herself
was
most
instructive
appeared
to
read
a
good
deal
upon
her
which
was
quite
invisible
to
me
i
remarked
invisible
but
unnoticed
did
not
know
where
to
look
and
so
you
missed
all
that
was
important
i
can
never
bring
you
to
realise
the
importance
of
sleeves
the
suggestiveness
of
thumb
nails
or
the
great
issues
that
may
hang
from
a
boot
lace
what
did
you
gather
from
that
woman
s
appearance
it
she
had
a
slate
coloured
broad
brimmed
straw
hat
with
a
feather
of
a
brickish
red
jacket
was
black
with
black
beads
sewn
upon
it
and
a
fringe
of
little
black
jet
ornaments
dress
was
brown
rather
darker
than
coffee
colour
with
a
little
purple
plush
at
the
neck
and
sleeves
gloves
were
greyish
and
were
worn
through
at
the
right
forefinger
boots
i
didn
t
observe
had
small
round
hanging
gold
earrings
and
a
general
air
of
being
fairly
well
to
do
in
a
vulgar
comfortable
easy
going
way
clapped
his
hands
softly
together
and
chuckled
my
word
you
are
coming
along
wonderfully
have
really
done
very
well
indeed
is
true
that
you
have
missed
everything
of
importance
but
you
have
hit
upon
the
method
and
you
have
a
quick
eye
for
colour
trust
to
general
impressions
my
boy
but
concentrate
yourself
upon
details
first
glance
is
always
at
a
woman
s
sleeve
a
man
it
is
perhaps
better
first
to
take
the
knee
of
the
trouser
you
observe
this
woman
had
plush
upon
her
sleeves
which
is
a
most
useful
material
for
showing
traces
double
line
a
little
above
the
wrist
where
the
typewritist
presses
against
the
table
was
beautifully
defined
sewing
machine
of
the
hand
type
leaves
a
similar
mark
but
only
on
the
left
arm
and
on
the
side
of
it
farthest
from
the
thumb
instead
of
being
right
across
the
broadest
part
as
this
was
i
then
glanced
at
her
face
and
observing
the
dint
of
a
pince
nez
at
either
side
of
her
nose
i
ventured
a
remark
upon
short
sight
and
typewriting
which
seemed
to
surprise
her
surprised
me
surely
it
was
obvious
i
was
then
much
surprised
and
interested
on
glancing
down
to
observe
that
though
the
boots
which
she
was
wearing
were
not
unlike
each
other
they
were
really
odd
ones
the
one
having
a
slightly
decorated
toe
cap
and
the
other
a
plain
one
was
buttoned
only
in
the
two
lower
buttons
out
of
five
and
the
other
at
the
first
third
and
fifth
when
you
see
that
a
young
lady
otherwise
neatly
dressed
has
come
away
from
home
with
odd
boots
half
buttoned
it
is
no
great
deduction
to
say
that
she
came
away
in
a
hurry
what
else
i
asked
keenly
interested
as
i
always
was
by
my
friend
s
incisive
reasoning
i
noted
in
passing
that
she
had
written
a
note
before
leaving
home
but
after
being
fully
dressed
observed
that
her
right
glove
was
torn
at
the
forefinger
but
you
did
not
apparently
see
that
both
glove
and
finger
were
stained
with
violet
ink
had
written
in
a
hurry
and
dipped
her
pen
too
deep
must
have
been
this
morning
or
the
mark
would
not
remain
clear
upon
the
finger
this
is
amusing
though
rather
elementary
but
i
must
go
back
to
business
you
mind
reading
me
the
advertised
description
of
i
held
the
little
printed
slip
to
the
light
it
said
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
a
gentleman
named
five
ft
seven
in
in
height
strongly
built
sallow
complexion
black
hair
a
little
bald
in
the
centre
bushy
black
side
whiskers
and
moustache
tinted
glasses
slight
infirmity
of
speech
dressed
when
last
seen
in
black
frock
coat
faced
with
silk
black
waistcoat
gold
chain
and
grey
tweed
trousers
with
brown
gaiters
over
elastic
sided
boots
to
have
been
employed
in
an
office
in
bringing
will
do
said
to
the
letters
he
continued
glancing
over
them
they
are
very
commonplace
no
clue
in
them
to
save
that
he
quotes
once
is
one
remarkable
point
however
which
will
no
doubt
strike
you
are
typewritten
i
remarked
only
that
but
the
signature
is
typewritten
at
the
neat
little
at
the
bottom
is
a
date
you
see
but
no
superscription
except
which
is
rather
vague
point
about
the
signature
is
very
suggestive
in
fact
we
may
call
it
conclusive
what
dear
fellow
is
it
possible
you
do
not
see
how
strongly
it
bears
upon
the
case
i
cannot
say
that
i
do
unless
it
were
that
he
wished
to
be
able
to
deny
his
signature
if
an
action
for
breach
of
promise
were
instituted
that
was
not
the
point
i
shall
write
two
letters
which
should
settle
the
matter
is
to
a
firm
in
the
the
other
is
to
the
young
lady
s
stepfather
asking
him
whether
he
could
meet
us
here
at
six
o
clock
tomorrow
evening
is
just
as
well
that
we
should
do
business
with
the
male
relatives
now
we
can
do
nothing
until
the
answers
to
those
letters
come
so
we
may
put
our
little
problem
upon
the
shelf
for
the
interim
i
had
had
so
many
reasons
to
believe
in
my
friend
s
subtle
powers
of
reasoning
and
extraordinary
energy
in
action
that
i
felt
that
he
must
have
some
solid
grounds
for
the
assured
and
easy
demeanour
with
which
he
treated
the
singular
mystery
which
he
had
been
called
upon
to
fathom
only
had
i
known
him
to
fail
in
the
case
of
the
of
and
of
the
photograph
but
when
i
looked
back
to
the
weird
business
of
the
of
and
the
extraordinary
circumstances
connected
with
the
in
i
felt
that
it
would
be
a
strange
tangle
indeed
which
he
could
not
unravel
i
left
him
then
still
puffing
at
his
black
clay
pipe
with
the
conviction
that
when
i
came
again
on
the
next
evening
i
would
find
that
he
held
in
his
hands
all
the
clues
which
would
lead
up
to
the
identity
of
the
disappearing
bridegroom
of
a
professional
case
of
great
gravity
was
engaging
my
own
attention
at
the
time
and
the
whole
of
next
day
i
was
busy
at
the
bedside
of
the
sufferer
was
not
until
close
upon
six
o
clock
that
i
found
myself
free
and
was
able
to
spring
into
a
hansom
and
drive
to
half
afraid
that
i
might
be
too
late
to
assist
at
the
d
nouement
of
the
little
mystery
i
found
alone
however
half
asleep
with
his
long
thin
form
curled
up
in
the
recesses
of
his
armchair
a
formidable
array
of
bottles
and
test
tubes
with
the
pungent
cleanly
smell
of
hydrochloric
acid
told
me
that
he
had
spent
his
day
in
the
chemical
work
which
was
so
dear
to
him
have
you
solved
it
i
asked
as
i
entered
was
the
bisulphate
of
baryta
no
the
mystery
i
cried
that
i
thought
of
the
salt
that
i
have
been
working
upon
was
never
any
mystery
in
the
matter
though
as
i
said
yesterday
some
of
the
details
are
of
interest
only
drawback
is
that
there
is
no
law
i
fear
that
can
touch
the
scoundrel
was
he
then
and
what
was
his
object
in
deserting
question
was
hardly
out
of
my
mouth
and
had
not
yet
opened
his
lips
to
reply
when
we
heard
a
heavy
footfall
in
the
passage
and
a
tap
at
the
door
is
the
girl
s
stepfather
said
has
written
to
me
to
say
that
he
would
be
here
at
six
in
man
who
entered
was
a
sturdy
middle
sized
fellow
some
thirty
years
of
age
clean
shaven
and
sallow
skinned
with
a
bland
insinuating
manner
and
a
pair
of
wonderfully
sharp
and
penetrating
grey
eyes
shot
a
questioning
glance
at
each
of
us
placed
his
shiny
top
hat
upon
the
sideboard
and
with
a
slight
bow
sidled
down
into
the
nearest
chair
evening
said
i
think
that
this
typewritten
letter
is
from
you
in
which
you
made
an
appointment
with
me
for
six
o
clock
sir
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
a
little
late
but
i
am
not
quite
my
own
master
you
know
i
am
sorry
that
has
troubled
you
about
this
little
matter
for
i
think
it
is
far
better
not
to
wash
linen
of
the
sort
in
public
was
quite
against
my
wishes
that
she
came
but
she
is
a
very
excitable
impulsive
girl
as
you
may
have
noticed
and
she
is
not
easily
controlled
when
she
has
made
up
her
mind
on
a
point
course
i
did
not
mind
you
so
much
as
you
are
not
connected
with
the
official
police
but
it
is
not
pleasant
to
have
a
family
misfortune
like
this
noised
abroad
it
is
a
useless
expense
for
how
could
you
possibly
find
this
the
contrary
said
quietly
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
i
will
succeed
in
discovering
gave
a
violent
start
and
dropped
his
gloves
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
he
said
is
a
curious
thing
remarked
that
a
typewriter
has
really
quite
as
much
individuality
as
a
man
s
handwriting
they
are
quite
new
no
two
of
them
write
exactly
alike
letters
get
more
worn
than
others
and
some
wear
only
on
one
side
you
remark
in
this
note
of
yours
that
in
every
case
there
is
some
little
slurring
over
of
the
e
and
a
slight
defect
in
the
tail
of
the
r
are
fourteen
other
characteristics
but
those
are
the
more
obvious
do
all
our
correspondence
with
this
machine
at
the
office
and
no
doubt
it
is
a
little
worn
our
visitor
answered
glancing
keenly
at
with
his
bright
little
eyes
now
i
will
show
you
what
is
really
a
very
interesting
study
continued
i
think
of
writing
another
little
monograph
some
of
these
days
on
the
typewriter
and
its
relation
to
crime
is
a
subject
to
which
i
have
devoted
some
little
attention
i
have
here
four
letters
which
purport
to
come
from
the
missing
man
are
all
typewritten
each
case
not
only
are
the
e
s
slurred
and
the
r
s
tailless
but
you
will
observe
if
you
care
to
use
my
magnifying
lens
that
the
fourteen
other
characteristics
to
which
i
have
alluded
are
there
as
well
sprang
out
of
his
chair
and
picked
up
his
hat
i
cannot
waste
time
over
this
sort
of
fantastic
talk
he
said
you
can
catch
the
man
catch
him
and
let
me
know
when
you
have
done
it
said
stepping
over
and
turning
the
key
in
the
door
i
let
you
know
then
that
i
have
caught
him
where
shouted
turning
white
to
his
lips
and
glancing
about
him
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
it
won
t
do
really
it
won
t
said
suavely
is
no
possible
getting
out
of
it
is
quite
too
transparent
and
it
was
a
very
bad
compliment
when
you
said
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
solve
so
simple
a
question
s
right
down
and
let
us
talk
it
over
visitor
collapsed
into
a
chair
with
a
ghastly
face
and
a
glitter
of
moisture
on
his
brow
it
s
not
actionable
he
stammered
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
it
is
not
between
ourselves
it
was
as
cruel
and
selfish
and
heartless
a
trick
in
a
petty
way
as
ever
came
before
me
let
me
just
run
over
the
course
of
events
and
you
will
contradict
me
if
i
go
wrong
man
sat
huddled
up
in
his
chair
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
like
one
who
is
utterly
crushed
stuck
his
feet
up
on
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
and
leaning
back
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
began
talking
rather
to
himself
as
it
seemed
than
to
us
man
married
a
woman
very
much
older
than
himself
for
her
money
said
he
and
he
enjoyed
the
use
of
the
money
of
the
daughter
as
long
as
she
lived
with
them
was
a
considerable
sum
for
people
in
their
position
and
the
loss
of
it
would
have
made
a
serious
difference
was
worth
an
effort
to
preserve
it
daughter
was
of
a
good
amiable
disposition
but
affectionate
and
warm
hearted
in
her
ways
so
that
it
was
evident
that
with
her
fair
personal
advantages
and
her
little
income
she
would
not
be
allowed
to
remain
single
long
her
marriage
would
mean
of
course
the
loss
of
a
hundred
a
year
so
what
does
her
stepfather
do
to
prevent
it
takes
the
obvious
course
of
keeping
her
at
home
and
forbidding
her
to
seek
the
company
of
people
of
her
own
age
soon
he
found
that
that
would
not
answer
forever
became
restive
insisted
upon
her
rights
and
finally
announced
her
positive
intention
of
going
to
a
certain
ball
does
her
clever
stepfather
do
then
conceives
an
idea
more
creditable
to
his
head
than
to
his
heart
the
connivance
and
assistance
of
his
wife
he
disguised
himself
covered
those
keen
eyes
with
tinted
glasses
masked
the
face
with
a
moustache
and
a
pair
of
bushy
whiskers
sunk
that
clear
voice
into
an
insinuating
whisper
and
doubly
secure
on
account
of
the
girl
s
short
sight
he
appears
as
and
keeps
off
other
lovers
by
making
love
himself
was
only
a
joke
at
first
groaned
our
visitor
never
thought
that
she
would
have
been
so
carried
away
likely
not
that
may
be
the
young
lady
was
very
decidedly
carried
away
and
having
quite
made
up
her
mind
that
her
stepfather
was
in
the
suspicion
of
treachery
never
for
an
instant
entered
her
mind
was
flattered
by
the
gentleman
s
attentions
and
the
effect
was
increased
by
the
loudly
expressed
admiration
of
her
mother
began
to
call
for
it
was
obvious
that
the
matter
should
be
pushed
as
far
as
it
would
go
if
a
real
effect
were
to
be
produced
were
meetings
and
an
engagement
which
would
finally
secure
the
girl
s
affections
from
turning
towards
anyone
else
the
deception
could
not
be
kept
up
forever
pretended
journeys
to
were
rather
cumbrous
thing
to
do
was
clearly
to
bring
the
business
to
an
end
in
such
a
dramatic
manner
that
it
would
leave
a
permanent
impression
upon
the
young
lady
s
mind
and
prevent
her
from
looking
upon
any
other
suitor
for
some
time
to
come
those
vows
of
fidelity
exacted
upon
a
and
hence
also
the
allusions
to
a
possibility
of
something
happening
on
the
very
morning
of
the
wedding
wished
to
be
so
bound
to
and
so
uncertain
as
to
his
fate
that
for
ten
years
to
come
at
any
rate
she
would
not
listen
to
another
man
far
as
the
church
door
he
brought
her
and
then
as
he
could
go
no
farther
he
conveniently
vanished
away
by
the
old
trick
of
stepping
in
at
one
door
of
a
four
wheeler
and
out
at
the
other
i
think
that
was
the
chain
of
events
visitor
had
recovered
something
of
his
assurance
while
had
been
talking
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
now
with
a
cold
sneer
upon
his
pale
face
may
be
so
or
it
may
not
said
he
but
if
you
are
so
very
sharp
you
ought
to
be
sharp
enough
to
know
that
it
is
you
who
are
breaking
the
law
now
and
not
me
i
have
done
nothing
actionable
from
the
first
but
as
long
as
you
keep
that
door
locked
you
lay
yourself
open
to
an
action
for
assault
and
illegal
constraint
law
cannot
as
you
say
touch
you
said
unlocking
and
throwing
open
the
door
yet
there
never
was
a
man
who
deserved
punishment
more
the
young
lady
has
a
brother
or
a
friend
he
ought
to
lay
a
whip
across
your
shoulders
he
continued
flushing
up
at
the
sight
of
the
bitter
sneer
upon
the
man
s
face
it
is
not
part
of
my
duties
to
my
client
but
here
s
a
hunting
crop
handy
and
i
think
i
shall
just
treat
myself
to
took
two
swift
steps
to
the
whip
but
before
he
could
grasp
it
there
was
a
wild
clatter
of
steps
upon
the
stairs
the
heavy
hall
door
banged
and
from
the
window
we
could
see
running
at
the
top
of
his
speed
down
the
road
s
a
cold
blooded
scoundrel
said
laughing
as
he
threw
himself
down
into
his
chair
once
more
fellow
will
rise
from
crime
to
crime
until
he
does
something
very
bad
and
ends
on
a
gallows
case
has
in
some
respects
been
not
entirely
devoid
of
interest
i
cannot
now
entirely
see
all
the
steps
of
your
reasoning
i
remarked
of
course
it
was
obvious
from
the
first
that
this
must
have
some
strong
object
for
his
curious
conduct
and
it
was
equally
clear
that
the
only
man
who
really
profited
by
the
incident
as
far
as
we
could
see
was
the
stepfather
the
fact
that
the
two
men
were
never
together
but
that
the
one
always
appeared
when
the
other
was
away
was
suggestive
were
the
tinted
spectacles
and
the
curious
voice
which
both
hinted
at
a
disguise
as
did
the
bushy
whiskers
suspicions
were
all
confirmed
by
his
peculiar
action
in
typewriting
his
signature
which
of
course
inferred
that
his
handwriting
was
so
familiar
to
her
that
she
would
recognise
even
the
smallest
sample
of
it
see
all
these
isolated
facts
together
with
many
minor
ones
all
pointed
in
the
same
direction
how
did
you
verify
them
once
spotted
my
man
it
was
easy
to
get
corroboration
i
knew
the
firm
for
which
this
man
worked
taken
the
printed
description
i
eliminated
everything
from
it
which
could
be
the
result
of
a
disguise
the
whiskers
the
glasses
the
voice
and
i
sent
it
to
the
firm
with
a
request
that
they
would
inform
me
whether
it
answered
to
the
description
of
any
of
their
travellers
i
had
already
noticed
the
peculiarities
of
the
typewriter
and
i
wrote
to
the
man
himself
at
his
business
address
asking
him
if
he
would
come
here
i
expected
his
reply
was
typewritten
and
revealed
the
same
trivial
but
characteristic
defects
same
post
brought
me
a
letter
from
of
to
say
that
the
description
tallied
in
every
respect
with
that
of
their
employ
tout
i
tell
her
she
will
not
believe
me
may
remember
the
old
saying

danger
for
him
who
taketh
the

and
danger
also
for
whoso
snatches

seated
at
breakfast
one
morning
my
wife
and
i
when
the
maid
brought
in
a
telegram
was
from
and
ran
in
this
way
you
a
couple
of
days
to
spare
just
been
wired
for
from
the
west
of

be
glad
if
you

come
with
me
and
scenery
perfect
by
the

you
say
dear
said
my
wife
looking
across
at
me
you
go
i
really
don
t
know
what
to
say
i
have
a
fairly
long
list
at
present
would
do
your
work
for
you
have
been
looking
a
little
pale
lately
i
think
that
the
change
would
do
you
good
and
you
are
always
so
interested
in
cases
i
should
be
ungrateful
if
i
were
not
seeing
what
i
gained
through
one
of
them
i
answered
if
i
am
to
go
i
must
pack
at
once
for
i
have
only
half
an
hour
experience
of
camp
life
in
had
at
least
had
the
effect
of
making
me
a
prompt
and
ready
traveller
wants
were
few
and
simple
so
that
in
less
than
the
time
stated
i
was
in
a
cab
with
my
valise
rattling
away
to
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
platform
his
tall
gaunt
figure
made
even
gaunter
and
taller
by
his
long
grey
travelling
cloak
and
close
fitting
cloth
cap
is
really
very
good
of
you
to
come
said
he
makes
a
considerable
difference
to
me
having
someone
with
me
on
whom
i
can
thoroughly
rely
aid
is
always
either
worthless
or
else
biassed
you
will
keep
the
two
corner
seats
i
shall
get
the
tickets
had
the
carriage
to
ourselves
save
for
an
immense
litter
of
papers
which
had
brought
with
him
these
he
rummaged
and
read
with
intervals
of
note
taking
and
of
meditation
until
we
were
past
he
suddenly
rolled
them
all
into
a
gigantic
ball
and
tossed
them
up
onto
the
rack
you
heard
anything
of
the
case
he
asked
a
word
i
have
not
seen
a
paper
for
some
days
press
has
not
had
very
full
accounts
i
have
just
been
looking
through
all
the
recent
papers
in
order
to
master
the
particulars
seems
from
what
i
gather
to
be
one
of
those
simple
cases
which
are
so
extremely
difficult
sounds
a
little
paradoxical
it
is
profoundly
true
is
almost
invariably
a
clue
more
featureless
and
commonplace
a
crime
is
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
bring
it
home
this
case
however
they
have
established
a
very
serious
case
against
the
son
of
the
murdered
man
is
a
murder
then
it
is
conjectured
to
be
so
i
shall
take
nothing
for
granted
until
i
have
the
opportunity
of
looking
personally
into
it
i
will
explain
the
state
of
things
to
you
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
understand
it
in
a
very
few
words
is
a
country
district
not
very
far
from
in
largest
landed
proprietor
in
that
part
is
a
who
made
his
money
in
and
returned
some
years
ago
to
the
old
country
of
the
farms
which
he
held
that
of
was
let
to
who
was
also
an
ex
men
had
known
each
other
in
the
colonies
so
that
it
was
not
unnatural
that
when
they
came
to
settle
down
they
should
do
so
as
near
each
other
as
possible
was
apparently
the
richer
man
so
became
his
tenant
but
still
remained
it
seems
upon
terms
of
perfect
equality
as
they
were
frequently
together
had
one
son
a
lad
of
eighteen
and
had
an
only
daughter
of
the
same
age
but
neither
of
them
had
wives
living
appear
to
have
avoided
the
society
of
the
neighbouring
families
and
to
have
led
retired
lives
though
both
the
were
fond
of
sport
and
were
frequently
seen
at
the

of
the

and
a

a
considerable
household
some
half
dozen
at
the
least

as
much
as
i
have
been
able
to
gather
about
the

the
facts

that

his
house
at
about
three
in
the
afternoon

walked
down
to
the
which

by

out
with
his
serving
man
in
the
morning

and
he
had
told
the
man
that
he
must
hurry
as
he
had
an
appointment
of
importance
to
keep
at

that
appointment
he
never
came
back
alive

to

quarter
of
a
mile
and
two
people
saw
him
as
he
passed
over
this
ground
was
an
old
woman
whose
name
is
not
mentioned
and
the
other
was
a
game
keeper

the
employ
of
these
witnesses

that
was
walking
alone
game
keeper
adds
that
within
a
few
minutes
of
his
seeing
pass
he
had
seen
his
son
going
the
same
way
with
a
gun
under
his
arm
the
best
of
his
belief
the
father
was
actually
in
sight
at
the
time
and
the
son
was
following
him
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
until
he
heard
in
the
evening
of
the
tragedy
that
had
occurred
two
were
seen
after
the
time
when
the
game
keeper
lost
sight
of
them
is
thickly
wooded
round
with
just
a
fringe
of
grass
and
of
reeds
round
the
edge
a
girl
of
fourteen
who
is
the
daughter
of
the
lodge
keeper
of
the
estate
was
in
one
of
the
woods
picking
flowers
states
that
while
she
was
there
she
saw
at
the
border
of
the
wood
and
close
by
the
lake
and
his
son
and
that
they
appeared
to
be
having
a
violent
quarrel
heard
the
elder
using
very
strong
language
to
his
son
and
she
saw
the
latter
raise
up
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
his
father
was
so
frightened
by
their
violence
that
she
ran
away
and
told
her
mother
when
she
reached
home
that
she
had
left
the
two
quarrelling
near
and
that
she
was
afraid
that
they
were
going
to
fight
had
hardly
said
the
words
when
young
came
running
up
to
the
lodge
to
say
that
he
had
found
his
father
dead
in
the
wood
and
to
ask
for
the
help
of
the
lodge
keeper
was
much
excited
without
either
his
gun
or
his
hat
and
his
right
hand
and
sleeve
were
observed
to
be
stained
with
fresh
blood
following
him
they
found
the
dead
body
stretched
out
upon
the
grass
beside
the
pool
head
had
been
beaten
in
by
repeated
blows
of
some
heavy
and
blunt
weapon
injuries
were
such
as
might
very
well
have
been
inflicted
by
the
butt
end
of
his
son
s
gun
which
was
found
lying
on
the
grass
within
a
few
paces
of
the
body
these
circumstances
the
young
man
was
instantly
arrested
and
a
verdict
of
wilful
murder
having
been
returned
at
the
inquest
on
he
was
on
brought
before
the
magistrates
at
who
have
referred
the
case
to
the
next
are
the
main
facts
of
the
case
as
they
came
out
before
the
coroner
and
the
police
court
i
could
hardly
imagine
a
more
damning
case
i
remarked
ever
circumstantial
evidence
pointed
to
a
criminal
it
does
so
here
evidence
is
a
very
tricky
thing
answered
thoughtfully
may
seem
to
point
very
straight
to
one
thing
but
if
you
shift
your
own
point
of
view
a
little
you
may
find
it
pointing
in
an
equally
uncompromising
manner
to
something
entirely
different
must
be
confessed
however
that
the
case
looks
exceedingly
grave
against
the
young
man
and
it
is
very
possible
that
he
is
indeed
the
culprit
are
several
people
in
the
neighbourhood
however
and
among
them
the
daughter
of
the
neighbouring
landowner
who
believe
in
his
innocence
and
who
have
retained
whom
you
may
recollect
in
connection
with
the
in
to
work
out
the
case
in
his
interest
being
rather
puzzled
has
referred
the
case
to
me
and
hence
it
is
that
two
middle
aged
gentlemen
are
flying
westward
at
fifty
miles
an
hour
instead
of
quietly
digesting
their
breakfasts
at
home
i
am
afraid
said
i
that
the
facts
are
so
obvious
that
you
will
find
little
credit
to
be
gained
out
of
this
case
is
nothing
more
deceptive
than
an
obvious
fact
he
answered
laughing
we
may
chance
to
hit
upon
some
other
obvious
facts
which
may
have
been
by
no
means
obvious
to
know
me
too
well
to
think
that
i
am
boasting
when
i
say
that
i
shall
either
confirm
or
destroy
his
theory
by
means
which
he
is
quite
incapable
of
employing
or
even
of
understanding
take
the
first
example
to
hand
i
very
clearly
perceive
that
in
your
bedroom
the
window
is
upon
the
right
hand
side
and
yet
i
question
whether
would
have
noted
even
so
self
evident
a
thing
as
that
on
earth
dear
fellow
i
know
you
well
i
know
the
military
neatness
which
characterises
you
shave
every
morning
and
in
this
season
you
shave
by
the
sunlight
but
since
your
shaving
is
less
and
less
complete
as
we
get
farther
back
on
the
left
side
until
it
becomes
positively
slovenly
as
we
get
round
the
angle
of
the
jaw
it
is
surely
very
clear
that
that
side
is
less
illuminated
than
the
other
i
could
not
imagine
a
man
of
your
habits
looking
at
himself
in
an
equal
light
and
being
satisfied
with
such
a
result
i
only
quote
this
as
a
trivial
example
of
observation
and
inference
lies
my
m
tier
and
it
is
just
possible
that
it
may
be
of
some
service
in
the
investigation
which
lies
before
us
are
one
or
two
minor
points
which
were
brought
out
in
the
inquest
and
which
are
worth
considering
are
they
appears
that
his
arrest
did
not
take
place
at
once
but
after
the
return
to
the
inspector
of
constabulary
informing
him
that
he
was
a
prisoner
he
remarked
that
he
was
not
surprised
to
hear
it
and
that
it
was
no
more
than
his
deserts
observation
of
his
had
the
natural
effect
of
removing
any
traces
of
doubt
which
might
have
remained
in
the
minds
of
the
coroner
s
jury
was
a
confession
i
ejaculated
for
it
was
followed
by
a
protestation
of
innocence
on
the
top
of
such
a
damning
series
of
events
it
was
at
least
a
most
suspicious
remark
the
contrary
said
it
is
the
brightest
rift
which
i
can
at
present
see
in
the
clouds
innocent
he
might
be
he
could
not
be
such
an
absolute
imbecile
as
not
to
see
that
the
circumstances
were
very
black
against
him
he
appeared
surprised
at
his
own
arrest
or
feigned
indignation
at
it
i
should
have
looked
upon
it
as
highly
suspicious
because
such
surprise
or
anger
would
not
be
natural
under
the
circumstances
and
yet
might
appear
to
be
the
best
policy
to
a
scheming
man
frank
acceptance
of
the
situation
marks
him
as
either
an
innocent
man
or
else
as
a
man
of
considerable
self
restraint
and
firmness
to
his
remark
about
his
deserts
it
was
also
not
unnatural
if
you
consider
that
he
stood
beside
the
dead
body
of
his
father
and
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
that
very
day
so
far
forgotten
his
filial
duty
as
to
bandy
words
with
him
and
even
according
to
the
little
girl
whose
evidence
is
so
important
to
raise
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
him
self
reproach
and
contrition
which
are
displayed
in
his
remark
appear
to
me
to
be
the
signs
of
a
healthy
mind
rather
than
of
a
guilty
one
i
shook
my
head
men
have
been
hanged
on
far
slighter
evidence
i
remarked
they
have
many
men
have
been
wrongfully
hanged
is
the
young
man
s
own
account
of
the
matter
is
i
am
afraid
not
very
encouraging
to
his
supporters
though
there
are
one
or
two
points
in
it
which
are
suggestive
will
find
it
here
and
may
read
it
for
yourself
picked
out
from
his
bundle
a
copy
of
the
local
paper
and
having
turned
down
the
sheet
he
pointed
out
the
paragraph
in
which
the
unfortunate
young
man
had
given
his
own
statement
of
what
had
occurred
i
settled
myself
down
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
and
read
it
very
carefully
ran
in
this
way
the
only
son
of
the
deceased
was
then
called
and
gave
evidence
as
follows
i
had
been
away
from
home
for
three
days
at
and
had
only
just
returned
upon
the
morning
of
last
the
rd
father
was
absent
from
home
at
the
time
of
my
arrival
and
i
was
informed
by
the
maid
that
he
had
driven
over
to
with
the
groom
after
my
return
i
heard
the
wheels
of
his
trap
in
the
yard
and
looking
out
of
my
window
i
saw
him
get
out
and
walk
rapidly
out
of
the
yard
though
i
was
not
aware
in
which
direction
he
was
going
i
then
took
my
gun
and
strolled
out
in
the
direction
of
the
with
the
intention
of
visiting
the
rabbit
warren
which
is
upon
the
other
side
my
way
i
saw
the
game
keeper
as
he
had
stated
in
his
evidence
but
he
is
mistaken
in
thinking
that
i
was
following
my
father
i
had
no
idea
that
he
was
in
front
of
me
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
pool
i
heard
a
cry
of
which
was
a
usual
signal
between
my
father
and
myself
i
then
hurried
forward
and
found
him
standing
by
the
pool
appeared
to
be
much
surprised
at
seeing
me
and
asked
me
rather
roughly
what
i
was
doing
there
a
conversation
ensued
which
led
to
high
words
and
almost
to
blows
for
my
father
was
a
man
of
a
very
violent
temper
that
his
passion
was
becoming
ungovernable
i
left
him
and
returned
towards
i
had
not
gone
more
than
yards
however
when
i
heard
a
hideous
outcry
behind
me
which
caused
me
to
run
back
again
i
found
my
father
expiring
upon
the
ground
with
his
head
terribly
injured
i
dropped
my
gun
and
held
him
in
my
arms
but
he
almost
instantly
expired
i
knelt
beside
him
for
some
minutes
and
then
made
my
way
to
s
lodge
keeper
his
house
being
the
nearest
to
ask
for
assistance
i
saw
no
one
near
my
father
when
i
returned
and
i
have
no
idea
how
he
came
by
his
injuries
was
not
a
popular
man
being
somewhat
cold
and
forbidding
in
his
manners
but
he
had
as
far
as
i
know
no
active
enemies
i
know
nothing
further
of
the
matter
your
father
make
any
statement
to
you
before
he
died
mumbled
a
few
words
but
i
could
only
catch
some
allusion
to
a
rat
did
you
understand
by
that
conveyed
no
meaning
to
me
i
thought
that
he
was
delirious
was
the
point
upon
which
you
and
your
father
had
this
final
quarrel
i
should
prefer
not
to
answer
i
am
afraid
that
i
must
press
it
is
really
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you
i
can
assure
you
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sad
tragedy
which
followed
is
for
the
court
to
decide
i
need
not
point
out
to
you
that
your
refusal
to
answer
will
prejudice
your
case
considerably
in
any
future
proceedings
which
may
arise
i
must
still
refuse
i
understand
that
the
cry
of
was
a
common
signal
between
you
and
your
father
was
was
it
then
that
he
uttered
it
before
he
saw
you
and
before
he
even
knew
that
you
had
returned
from
with
considerable
confusion
i
do
not
know
a
you
see
nothing
which
aroused
your
suspicions
when
you
returned
on
hearing
the
cry
and
found
your
father
fatally
injured
definite
do
you
mean
i
was
so
disturbed
and
excited
as
i
rushed
out
into
the
open
that
i
could
think
of
nothing
except
of
my
father
i
have
a
vague
impression
that
as
i
ran
forward
something
lay
upon
the
ground
to
the
left
of
me
seemed
to
me
to
be
something
grey
in
colour
a
coat
of
some
sort
or
a
plaid
perhaps
i
rose
from
my
father
i
looked
round
for
it
but
it
was
gone
you
mean
that
it
disappeared
before
you
went
for
help
it
was
gone
cannot
say
what
it
was
i
had
a
feeling
something
was
there
far
from
the
body
a
dozen
yards
or
so
how
far
from
the
edge
of
the
wood
the
same
if
it
was
removed
it
was
while
you
were
within
a
dozen
yards
of
it
but
with
my
back
towards
it
concluded
the
examination
of
the
witness
i
see
said
i
as
i
glanced
down
the
column
that
the
coroner
in
his
concluding
remarks
was
rather
severe
upon
young
calls
attention
and
with
reason
to
the
discrepancy
about
his
father
having
signalled
to
him
before
seeing
him
also
to
his
refusal
to
give
details
of
his
conversation
with
his
father
and
his
singular
account
of
his
father
s
dying
words
are
all
as
he
remarks
very
much
against
the
son
laughed
softly
to
himself
and
stretched
himself
out
upon
the
cushioned
seat
you
and
the
coroner
have
been
at
some
pains
said
he
to
single
out
the
very
strongest
points
in
the
young
man
s
favour
t
you
see
that
you
alternately
give
him
credit
for
having
too
much
imagination
and
too
little
little
if
he
could
not
invent
a
cause
of
quarrel
which
would
give
him
the
sympathy
of
the
jury
too
much
if
he
evolved
from
his
own
inner
consciousness
anything
so
outr
as
a
dying
reference
to
a
rat
and
the
incident
of
the
vanishing
cloth
sir
i
shall
approach
this
case
from
the
point
of
view
that
what
this
young
man
says
is
true
and
we
shall
see
whither
that
hypothesis
will
lead
us
now
here
is
my
pocket
and
not
another
word
shall
i
say
of
this
case
until
we
are
on
the
scene
of
action
lunch
at
and
i
see
that
we
shall
be
there
in
twenty
minutes
was
nearly
four
o
clock
when
we
at
last
after
passing
through
the
beautiful
and
over
the
broad
gleaming
found
ourselves
at
the
pretty
little
country
town
of
a
lean
ferret
like
man
furtive
and
sly
looking
was
waiting
for
us
upon
the
platform
spite
of
the
light
brown
dustcoat
and
leather
leggings
which
he
wore
in
deference
to
his
rustic
surroundings
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
of
him
we
drove
to
the
where
a
room
had
already
been
engaged
for
us
i
have
ordered
a
carriage
said
as
we
sat
over
a
cup
of
tea
i
knew
your
energetic
nature
and
that
you
would
not
be
happy
until
you
had
been
on
the
scene
of
the
crime
was
very
nice
and
complimentary
of
you
answered
is
entirely
a
question
of
barometric
pressure
looked
startled
i
do
not
quite
follow
he
said
is
the
glass
nine
i
see
wind
and
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
i
have
a
caseful
of
cigarettes
here
which
need
smoking
and
the
sofa
is
very
much
superior
to
the
usual
country
hotel
abomination
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
probable
that
i
shall
use
the
carriage
to
night
laughed
indulgently
have
no
doubt
already
formed
your
conclusions
from
the
newspapers
he
said
case
is
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
and
the
more
one
goes
into
it
the
plainer
it
becomes
of
course
one
can
t
refuse
a
lady
and
such
a
very
positive
one
too
has
heard
of
you
and
would
have
your
opinion
though
i
repeatedly
told
her
that
there
was
nothing
which
you
could
do
which
i
had
not
already
done
bless
my
soul
here
is
her
carriage
at
the
door
had
hardly
spoken
before
there
rushed
into
the
room
one
of
the
most
lovely
young
women
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
violet
eyes
shining
her
lips
parted
a
pink
flush
upon
her
cheeks
all
thought
of
her
natural
reserve
lost
in
her
overpowering
excitement
and
concern
she
cried
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
and
finally
with
a
woman
s
quick
intuition
fastening
upon
my
companion
i
am
so
glad
that
you
have
come
i
have
driven
down
to
tell
you
so
i
know
that
didn
t
do
it
i
know
it
and
i
want
you
to
start
upon
your
work
knowing
it
too
let
yourself
doubt
upon
that
point
have
known
each
other
since
we
were
little
children
and
i
know
his
faults
as
no
one
else
does
but
he
is
too
tender
hearted
to
hurt
a
fly
a
charge
is
absurd
to
anyone
who
really
knows
him
i
hope
we
may
clear
him
said
may
rely
upon
my
doing
all
that
i
can
you
have
read
the
evidence
have
formed
some
conclusion
you
not
see
some
loophole
some
flaw
you
not
yourself
think
that
he
is
innocent
i
think
that
it
is
very
probable
now
she
cried
throwing
back
her
head
and
looking
defiantly
at
hear
gives
me
hopes
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
am
afraid
that
my
colleague
has
been
a
little
quick
in
forming
his
conclusions
he
said
he
is
right
i
know
that
he
is
right
never
did
it
about
his
quarrel
with
his
father
i
am
sure
that
the
reason
why
he
would
not
speak
about
it
to
the
coroner
was
because
i
was
concerned
in
it
what
way
asked
is
no
time
for
me
to
hide
anything
and
his
father
had
many
disagreements
about
me
was
very
anxious
that
there
should
be
a
marriage
between
us
and
i
have
always
loved
each
other
as
brother
and
sister
but
of
course
he
is
young
and
has
seen
very
little
of
life
yet
and
and
well
he
naturally
did
not
wish
to
do
anything
like
that
yet
there
were
quarrels
and
this
i
am
sure
was
one
of
them
your
father
asked
he
in
favour
of
such
a
union
he
was
averse
to
it
also
one
but
was
in
favour
of
it
a
quick
blush
passed
over
her
fresh
young
face
as
shot
one
of
his
keen
questioning
glances
at
her
you
for
this
information
said
he
i
see
your
father
if
i
call
to
morrow
i
am
afraid
the
doctor
won
t
allow
it
doctor
have
you
not
heard
father
has
never
been
strong
for
years
back
but
this
has
broken
him
down
completely
has
taken
to
his
bed
and
says
that
he
is
a
wreck
and
that
his
nervous
system
is
shattered
was
the
only
man
alive
who
had
known
dad
in
the
old
days
in
is
important
at
the
mines
so
at
the
gold
mines
where
as
i
understand
made
his
money
certainly
you
have
been
of
material
assistance
to
me
will
tell
me
if
you
have
any
news
to
morrow
doubt
you
will
go
to
the
prison
to
see
if
you
do
do
tell
him
that
i
know
him
to
be
innocent
i
will
i
must
go
home
now
for
dad
is
very
ill
and
he
misses
me
so
if
i
leave
him
bye
and
help
you
in
your
undertaking
hurried
from
the
room
as
impulsively
as
she
had
entered
and
we
heard
the
wheels
of
her
carriage
rattle
off
down
the
street
i
am
ashamed
of
you
said
with
dignity
after
a
few
minutes
silence
should
you
raise
up
hopes
which
you
are
bound
to
disappoint
i
am
not
over
tender
of
heart
but
i
call
it
cruel
i
think
that
i
see
my
way
to
clearing
said
you
an
order
to
see
him
in
prison
but
only
for
you
and
me
i
shall
reconsider
my
resolution
about
going
out
have
still
time
to
take
a
train
to
and
see
him
to
night
let
us
do
so
i
fear
that
you
will
find
it
very
slow
but
i
shall
only
be
away
a
couple
of
hours
i
walked
down
to
the
station
with
them
and
then
wandered
through
the
streets
of
the
little
town
finally
returning
to
the
hotel
where
i
lay
upon
the
sofa
and
tried
to
interest
myself
in
a
yellow
backed
novel
puny
plot
of
the
story
was
so
thin
however
when
compared
to
the
deep
mystery
through
which
we
were
groping
and
i
found
my
attention
wander
so
continually
from
the
action
to
the
fact
that
i
at
last
flung
it
across
the
room
and
gave
myself
up
entirely
to
a
consideration
of
the
events
of
the
day
that
this
unhappy
young
man
s
story
were
absolutely
true
then
what
hellish
thing
what
absolutely
unforeseen
and
extraordinary
calamity
could
have
occurred
between
the
time
when
he
parted
from
his
father
and
the
moment
when
drawn
back
by
his
screams
he
rushed
into
the
glade
was
something
terrible
and
deadly
could
it
be
not
the
nature
of
the
injuries
reveal
something
to
my
medical
instincts
i
rang
the
bell
and
called
for
the
weekly
county
paper
which
contained
a
verbatim
account
of
the
inquest
the
surgeon
s
deposition
it
was
stated
that
the
posterior
third
of
the
left
parietal
bone
and
the
left
half
of
the
occipital
bone
had
been
shattered
by
a
heavy
blow
from
a
blunt
weapon
i
marked
the
spot
upon
my
own
head
such
a
blow
must
have
been
struck
from
behind
was
to
some
extent
in
favour
of
the
accused
as
when
seen
quarrelling
he
was
face
to
face
with
his
father
it
did
not
go
for
very
much
for
the
older
man
might
have
turned
his
back
before
the
blow
fell
it
might
be
worth
while
to
call
attention
to
it
there
was
the
peculiar
dying
reference
to
a
rat
could
that
mean
could
not
be
delirium
a
man
dying
from
a
sudden
blow
does
not
commonly
become
delirious
it
was
more
likely
to
be
an
attempt
to
explain
how
he
met
his
fate
what
could
it
indicate
i
cudgelled
my
brains
to
find
some
possible
explanation
then
the
incident
of
the
grey
cloth
seen
by
young
that
were
true
the
murderer
must
have
dropped
some
part
of
his
dress
presumably
his
overcoat
in
his
flight
and
must
have
had
the
hardihood
to
return
and
to
carry
it
away
at
the
instant
when
the
son
was
kneeling
with
his
back
turned
not
a
dozen
paces
off
a
tissue
of
mysteries
and
improbabilities
the
whole
thing
was
i
did
not
wonder
at
s
opinion
and
yet
i
had
so
much
faith
in
insight
that
i
could
not
lose
hope
as
long
as
every
fresh
fact
seemed
to
strengthen
his
conviction
of
young
s
innocence
was
late
before
returned
came
back
alone
for
was
staying
in
lodgings
in
the
town
glass
still
keeps
very
high
he
remarked
as
he
sat
down
is
of
importance
that
it
should
not
rain
before
we
are
able
to
go
over
the
ground
the
other
hand
a
man
should
be
at
his
very
best
and
keenest
for
such
nice
work
as
that
and
i
did
not
wish
to
do
it
when
fagged
by
a
long
journey
i
have
seen
young
what
did
you
learn
from
him
he
throw
no
light
at
all
i
was
inclined
to
think
at
one
time
that
he
knew
who
had
done
it
and
was
screening
him
or
her
but
i
am
convinced
now
that
he
is
as
puzzled
as
everyone
else
is
not
a
very
quick
witted
youth
though
comely
to
look
at
and
i
should
think
sound
at
heart
i
cannot
admire
his
taste
i
remarked
if
it
is
indeed
a
fact
that
he
was
averse
to
a
marriage
with
so
charming
a
young
lady
as
this
thereby
hangs
a
rather
painful
tale
fellow
is
madly
insanely
in
love
with
her
but
some
two
years
ago
when
he
was
only
a
lad
and
before
he
really
knew
her
for
she
had
been
away
five
years
at
a
boarding
school
what
does
the
idiot
do
but
get
into
the
clutches
of
a
barmaid
in
and
marry
her
at
a
registry
office
one
knows
a
word
of
the
matter
but
you
can
imagine
how
maddening
it
must
be
to
him
to
be
upbraided
for
not
doing
what
he
would
give
his
very
eyes
to
do
but
what
he
knows
to
be
absolutely
impossible
was
sheer
frenzy
of
this
sort
which
made
him
throw
his
hands
up
into
the
air
when
his
father
at
their
last
interview
was
goading
him
on
to
propose
to
the
other
hand
he
had
no
means
of
supporting
himself
and
his
father
who
was
by
all
accounts
a
very
hard
man
would
have
thrown
him
over
utterly
had
he
known
the
truth
was
with
his
barmaid
wife
that
he
had
spent
the
last
three
days
in
and
his
father
did
not
know
where
he
was
that
point
is
of
importance
has
come
out
of
evil
however
for
the
barmaid
finding
from
the
papers
that
he
is
in
serious
trouble
and
likely
to
be
hanged
has
thrown
him
over
utterly
and
has
written
to
him
to
say
that
she
has
a
husband
already
in
the
so
that
there
is
really
no
tie
between
them
i
think
that
that
bit
of
news
has
consoled
young
for
all
that
he
has
suffered
if
he
is
innocent
who
has
done
it
who
i
would
call
your
attention
very
particularly
to
two
points
is
that
the
murdered
man
had
an
appointment
with
someone
at
the
pool
and
that
the
someone
could
not
have
been
his
son
for
his
son
was
away
and
he
did
not
know
when
he
would
return
second
is
that
the
murdered
man
was
heard
to
cry
before
he
knew
that
his
son
had
returned
are
the
crucial
points
upon
which
the
case
depends
now
let
us
talk
about
if
you
please
and
we
shall
leave
all
minor
matters
until
to
morrow
was
no
rain
as
had
foretold
and
the
morning
broke
bright
and
cloudless
nine
o
clock
called
for
us
with
the
carriage
and
we
set
off
for
and
the
is
serious
news
this
morning
observed
is
said
that
of
the
is
so
ill
that
his
life
is
despaired
of
elderly
man
i
presume
said
sixty
but
his
constitution
has
been
shattered
by
his
life
abroad
and
he
has
been
in
failing
health
for
some
time
business
has
had
a
very
bad
effect
upon
him
was
an
old
friend
of
s
and
i
may
add
a
great
benefactor
to
him
for
i
have
learned
that
he
gave
him
rent
free
is
interesting
said
yes
a
hundred
other
ways
he
has
helped
him
about
here
speaks
of
his
kindness
to
him
it
not
strike
you
as
a
little
singular
that
this
who
appears
to
have
had
little
of
his
own
and
to
have
been
under
such
obligations
to
should
still
talk
of
marrying
his
son
to
s
daughter
who
is
presumably
heiress
to
the
estate
and
that
in
such
a
very
cocksure
manner
as
if
it
were
merely
a
case
of
a
proposal
and
all
else
would
follow
is
the
more
strange
since
we
know
that
himself
was
averse
to
the
idea
daughter
told
us
as
much
you
not
deduce
something
from
that
have
got
to
the
deductions
and
the
inferences
said
winking
at
me
i
find
it
hard
enough
to
tackle
facts
without
flying
away
after
theories
and
fancies
are
right
said
demurely
you
do
find
it
very
hard
to
tackle
the
facts
i
have
grasped
one
fact
which
you
seem
to
find
it
difficult
to
get
hold
of
replied
with
some
warmth
that
is
senior
met
his
death
from
junior
and
that
all
theories
to
the
contrary
are
the
merest
moonshine
moonshine
is
a
brighter
thing
than
fog
said
laughing
i
am
very
much
mistaken
if
this
is
not
upon
the
left
that
is
it
was
a
widespread
comfortable
looking
building
two
storied
slate
roofed
with
great
yellow
blotches
of
lichen
upon
the
grey
walls
drawn
blinds
and
the
smokeless
chimneys
however
gave
it
a
stricken
look
as
though
the
weight
of
this
horror
still
lay
heavy
upon
it
called
at
the
door
when
the
maid
at
request
showed
us
the
boots
which
her
master
wore
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
also
a
pair
of
the
son
s
though
not
the
pair
which
he
had
then
had
measured
these
very
carefully
from
seven
or
eight
different
points
desired
to
be
led
to
the
court
yard
from
which
we
all
followed
the
winding
track
which
led
to
was
transformed
when
he
was
hot
upon
such
a
scent
as
this
who
had
only
known
the
quiet
thinker
and
logician
of
would
have
failed
to
recognise
him
face
flushed
and
darkened
brows
were
drawn
into
two
hard
black
lines
while
his
eyes
shone
out
from
beneath
them
with
a
steely
glitter
face
was
bent
downward
his
shoulders
bowed
his
lips
compressed
and
the
veins
stood
out
like
whipcord
in
his
long
sinewy
neck
nostrils
seemed
to
dilate
with
a
purely
animal
lust
for
the
chase
and
his
mind
was
so
absolutely
concentrated
upon
the
matter
before
him
that
a
question
or
remark
fell
unheeded
upon
his
ears
or
at
the
most
only
provoked
a
quick
impatient
snarl
in
reply
and
silently
he
made
his
way
along
the
track
which
ran
through
the
meadows
and
so
by
way
of
the
woods
to
the
was
damp
marshy
ground
as
is
all
that
district
and
there
were
marks
of
many
feet
both
upon
the
path
and
amid
the
short
grass
which
bounded
it
on
either
side
would
hurry
on
sometimes
stop
dead
and
once
he
made
quite
a
little
detour
into
the
meadow
and
i
walked
behind
him
the
detective
indifferent
and
contemptuous
while
i
watched
my
friend
with
the
interest
which
sprang
from
the
conviction
that
every
one
of
his
actions
was
directed
towards
a
definite
end
which
is
a
little
reed
girt
sheet
of
water
some
fifty
yards
across
is
situated
at
the
boundary
between
the
and
the
private
park
of
the
wealthy
the
woods
which
lined
it
upon
the
farther
side
we
could
see
the
red
jutting
pinnacles
which
marked
the
site
of
the
rich
landowner
s
dwelling
the
side
of
the
pool
the
woods
grew
very
thick
and
there
was
a
narrow
belt
of
sodden
grass
twenty
paces
across
between
the
edge
of
the
trees
and
the
reeds
which
lined
the
lake
showed
us
the
exact
spot
at
which
the
body
had
been
found
and
indeed
so
moist
was
the
ground
that
i
could
plainly
see
the
traces
which
had
been
left
by
the
fall
of
the
stricken
man
as
i
could
see
by
his
eager
face
and
peering
eyes
very
many
other
things
were
to
be
read
upon
the
trampled
grass
ran
round
like
a
dog
who
is
picking
up
a
scent
and
then
turned
upon
my
companion
did
you
go
into
the
pool
for
he
asked
i
fished
about
with
a
rake
i
thought
there
might
be
some
weapon
or
other
trace
how
on
earth
tut
tut
i
have
no
time
left
foot
of
yours
with
its
inward
twist
is
all
over
the
place
a
mole
could
trace
it
and
there
it
vanishes
among
the
reeds
how
simple
it
would
all
have
been
had
i
been
here
before
they
came
like
a
herd
of
buffalo
and
wallowed
all
over
it
is
where
the
party
with
the
lodge
keeper
came
and
they
have
covered
all
tracks
for
six
or
eight
feet
round
the
body
here
are
three
separate
tracks
of
the
same
feet
drew
out
a
lens
and
lay
down
upon
his
waterproof
to
have
a
better
view
talking
all
the
time
rather
to
himself
than
to
us
are
young
s
feet
he
was
walking
and
once
he
ran
swiftly
so
that
the
soles
are
deeply
marked
and
the
heels
hardly
visible
bears
out
his
story
ran
when
he
saw
his
father
on
the
ground
here
are
the
father
s
feet
as
he
paced
up
and
down
is
this
then
is
the
butt
end
of
the
gun
as
the
son
stood
listening
this
ha
have
we
here
tiptoes
too
quite
unusual
boots
come
they
go
they
come
again
of
course
that
was
for
the
cloak
where
did
they
come
from
ran
up
and
down
sometimes
losing
sometimes
finding
the
track
until
we
were
well
within
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
under
the
shadow
of
a
great
beech
the
largest
tree
in
the
neighbourhood
traced
his
way
to
the
farther
side
of
this
and
lay
down
once
more
upon
his
face
with
a
little
cry
of
satisfaction
a
long
time
he
remained
there
turning
over
the
leaves
and
dried
sticks
gathering
up
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
dust
into
an
envelope
and
examining
with
his
lens
not
only
the
ground
but
even
the
bark
of
the
tree
as
far
as
he
could
reach
a
jagged
stone
was
lying
among
the
moss
and
this
also
he
carefully
examined
and
retained
he
followed
a
pathway
through
the
wood
until
he
came
to
the
highroad
where
all
traces
were
lost
has
been
a
case
of
considerable
interest
he
remarked
returning
to
his
natural
manner
i
fancy
that
this
grey
house
on
the
right
must
be
the
lodge
i
think
that
i
will
go
in
and
have
a
word
with
and
perhaps
write
a
little
note
done
that
we
may
drive
back
to
our
luncheon
may
walk
to
the
cab
and
i
shall
be
with
you
presently
was
about
ten
minutes
before
we
regained
our
cab
and
drove
back
into
still
carrying
with
him
the
stone
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
wood
may
interest
you
he
remarked
holding
it
out
murder
was
done
with
it
i
see
no
marks
are
none
do
you
know
then
grass
was
growing
under
it
had
only
lain
there
a
few
days
was
no
sign
of
a
place
whence
it
had
been
taken
corresponds
with
the
injuries
is
no
sign
of
any
other
weapon
the
murderer
a
tall
man
left
handed
limps
with
the
right
leg
wears
thick
soled
shooting
boots
and
a
grey
cloak
smokes
cigars
uses
a
cigar
holder
and
carries
a
blunt
pen
knife
in
his
pocket
are
several
other
indications
but
these
may
be
enough
to
aid
us
in
our
search
laughed
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
still
a
sceptic
he
said
are
all
very
well
but
we
have
to
deal
with
a
hard
headed
jury
verrons
answered
calmly
work
your
own
method
and
i
shall
work
mine
i
shall
be
busy
this
afternoon
and
shall
probably
return
to
by
the
evening
train
leave
your
case
unfinished
finished
the
mystery
is
solved
was
the
criminal
then
gentleman
i
describe
who
is
he
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
find
out
is
not
such
a
populous
neighbourhood
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
am
a
practical
man
he
said
and
i
really
cannot
undertake
to
go
about
the
country
looking
for
a
left
handed
gentleman
with
a
game
leg
i
should
become
the
laughing
stock
of
right
said
quietly
i
have
given
you
the
chance
are
your
lodgings
bye
i
shall
drop
you
a
line
before
i
leave
left
at
his
rooms
we
drove
to
our
hotel
where
we
found
lunch
upon
the
table
was
silent
and
buried
in
thought
with
a
pained
expression
upon
his
face
as
one
who
finds
himself
in
a
perplexing
position
here
he
said
when
the
cloth
was
cleared
just
sit
down
in
this
chair
and
let
me
preach
to
you
for
a
little
i
don
t
know
quite
what
to
do
and
i
should
value
your
advice
a
cigar
and
let
me
expound
do
so
now
in
considering
this
case
there
are
two
points
about
young
s
narrative
which
struck
us
both
instantly
although
they
impressed
me
in
his
favour
and
you
against
him
was
the
fact
that
his
father
should
according
to
his
account
cry
before
seeing
him
other
was
his
singular
dying
reference
to
a
rat
mumbled
several
words
you
understand
but
that
was
all
that
caught
the
son
s
ear
from
this
double
point
our
research
must
commence
and
we
will
begin
it
by
presuming
that
what
the
lad
says
is
absolutely
true
of
this
then
obviously
it
could
not
have
been
meant
for
the
son
son
as
far
as
he
knew
was
in
was
mere
chance
that
he
was
within
earshot
was
meant
to
attract
the
attention
of
whoever
it
was
that
he
had
the
appointment
with
is
a
distinctly
cry
and
one
which
is
used
between
is
a
strong
presumption
that
the
person
whom
expected
to
meet
him
at
was
someone
who
had
been
in
of
the
rat
then
took
a
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
and
flattened
it
out
on
the
table
is
a
map
of
the
of
he
said
i
wired
to
for
it
last
night
put
his
hand
over
part
of
the
map
do
you
read
arat
i
read
now
raised
his
hand
ballarat
so
was
the
word
the
man
uttered
and
of
which
his
son
only
caught
the
last
two
syllables
was
trying
to
utter
the
name
of
his
murderer
and
so
of
is
wonderful
i
exclaimed
is
obvious
now
you
see
i
had
narrowed
the
field
down
considerably
possession
of
a
grey
garment
was
a
third
point
which
granting
the
son
s
statement
to
be
correct
was
a
certainty
have
come
now
out
of
mere
vagueness
to
the
definite
conception
of
an
from
with
a
grey
cloak
one
who
was
at
home
in
the
district
for
the
pool
can
only
be
approached
by
the
farm
or
by
the
estate
where
strangers
could
hardly
wander
so
comes
our
expedition
of
to
day
an
examination
of
the
ground
i
gained
the
trifling
details
which
i
gave
to
that
imbecile
as
to
the
personality
of
the
criminal
how
did
you
gain
them
know
my
method
is
founded
upon
the
observation
of
trifles
height
i
know
that
you
might
roughly
judge
from
the
length
of
his
stride
boots
too
might
be
told
from
their
traces
they
were
peculiar
boots
his
lameness
impression
of
his
right
foot
was
always
less
distinct
than
his
left
put
less
weight
upon
it
he
limped
he
was
lame
his
left
handedness
were
yourself
struck
by
the
nature
of
the
injury
as
recorded
by
the
surgeon
at
the
inquest
blow
was
struck
from
immediately
behind
and
yet
was
upon
the
left
side
how
can
that
be
unless
it
were
by
a
left
handed
man
had
stood
behind
that
tree
during
the
interview
between
the
father
and
son
had
even
smoked
there
i
found
the
ash
of
a
cigar
which
my
special
knowledge
of
tobacco
ashes
enables
me
to
pronounce
as
an
cigar
i
have
as
you
know
devoted
some
attention
to
this
and
written
a
little
monograph
on
the
ashes
of
different
varieties
of
pipe
cigar
and
cigarette
tobacco
found
the
ash
i
then
looked
round
and
discovered
the
stump
among
the
moss
where
he
had
tossed
it
was
an
cigar
of
the
variety
which
are
rolled
in
the
cigar
holder
i
could
see
that
the
end
had
not
been
in
his
mouth
he
used
a
holder
tip
had
been
cut
off
not
bitten
off
but
the
cut
was
not
a
clean
one
so
i
deduced
a
blunt
pen
knife
i
said
you
have
drawn
a
net
round
this
man
from
which
he
cannot
escape
and
you
have
saved
an
innocent
human
life
as
truly
as
if
you
had
cut
the
cord
which
was
hanging
him
i
see
the
direction
in
which
all
this
points
culprit
is
cried
the
hotel
waiter
opening
the
door
of
our
sitting
room
and
ushering
in
a
visitor
man
who
entered
was
a
strange
and
impressive
figure
slow
limping
step
and
bowed
shoulders
gave
the
appearance
of
decrepitude
and
yet
his
hard
deep
lined
craggy
features
and
his
enormous
limbs
showed
that
he
was
possessed
of
unusual
strength
of
body
and
of
character
tangled
beard
grizzled
hair
and
outstanding
drooping
eyebrows
combined
to
give
an
air
of
dignity
and
power
to
his
appearance
but
his
face
was
of
an
ashen
white
while
his
lips
and
the
corners
of
his
nostrils
were
tinged
with
a
shade
of
blue
was
clear
to
me
at
a
glance
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
some
deadly
and
chronic
disease
sit
down
on
the
sofa
said
gently
had
my
note
the
lodge
keeper
brought
it
up
said
that
you
wished
to
see
me
here
to
avoid
scandal
i
thought
people
would
talk
if
i
went
to
the
why
did
you
wish
to
see
me
looked
across
at
my
companion
with
despair
in
his
weary
eyes
as
though
his
question
was
already
answered
said
answering
the
look
rather
than
the
words
is
so
i
know
all
about
old
man
sank
his
face
in
his
hands
help
me
he
cried
i
would
not
have
let
the
young
man
come
to
harm
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
would
have
spoken
out
if
it
went
against
him
at
the
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
said
gravely
i
would
have
spoken
now
had
it
not
been
for
my
dear
girl
would
break
her
heart
it
will
break
her
heart
when
she
hears
that
i
am
arrested
may
not
come
to
that
said
i
am
no
official
agent
i
understand
that
it
was
your
daughter
who
required
my
presence
here
and
i
am
acting
in
her
interests
must
be
got
off
however
i
am
a
dying
man
said
old
i
have
had
diabetes
for
years
doctor
says
it
is
a
question
whether
i
shall
live
a
month
i
would
rather
die
under
my
own
roof
than
in
a
gaol
rose
and
sat
down
at
the
table
with
his
pen
in
his
hand
and
a
bundle
of
paper
before
him
tell
us
the
truth
he
said
i
shall
jot
down
the
facts
will
sign
it
and
here
can
witness
it
i
could
produce
your
confession
at
the
last
extremity
to
save
young
i
promise
you
that
i
shall
not
use
it
unless
it
is
absolutely
needed
s
as
well
said
the
old
man
it
s
a
question
whether
i
shall
live
to
the
so
it
matters
little
to
me
but
i
should
wish
to
spare
the
shock
now
i
will
make
the
thing
clear
to
you
it
has
been
a
long
time
in
the
acting
but
will
not
take
me
long
to
tell
didn
t
know
this
dead
man
was
a
devil
incarnate
i
tell
you
that
keep
you
out
of
the
clutches
of
such
a
man
as
he
grip
has
been
upon
me
these
twenty
years
and
he
has
blasted
my
life
i
ll
tell
you
first
how
i
came
to
be
in
his
power
was
in
the
early
s
at
the
diggings
i
was
a
young
chap
then
hot
blooded
and
reckless
ready
to
turn
my
hand
at
anything
i
got
among
bad
companions
took
to
drink
had
no
luck
with
my
claim
took
to
the
bush
and
in
a
word
became
what
you
would
call
over
here
a
highway
robber
were
six
of
us
and
we
had
a
wild
free
life
of
it
sticking
up
a
station
from
time
to
time
or
stopping
the
wagons
on
the
road
to
the
diggings
of
was
the
name
i
went
under
and
our
party
is
still
remembered
in
the
colony
as
the
day
a
gold
convoy
came
down
from
to
and
we
lay
in
wait
for
it
and
attacked
it
were
six
troopers
and
six
of
us
so
it
was
a
close
thing
but
we
emptied
four
of
their
saddles
at
the
first
volley
of
our
boys
were
killed
however
before
we
got
the
swag
i
put
my
pistol
to
the
head
of
the
wagon
driver
who
was
this
very
man
i
wish
to
the
that
i
had
shot
him
then
but
i
spared
him
though
i
saw
his
wicked
little
eyes
fixed
on
my
face
as
though
to
remember
every
feature
got
away
with
the
gold
became
wealthy
men
and
made
our
way
over
to
without
being
suspected
i
parted
from
my
old
pals
and
determined
to
settle
down
to
a
quiet
and
respectable
life
i
bought
this
estate
which
chanced
to
be
in
the
market
and
i
set
myself
to
do
a
little
good
with
my
money
to
make
up
for
the
way
in
which
i
had
earned
it
i
married
too
and
though
my
wife
died
young
she
left
me
my
dear
little
when
she
was
just
a
baby
her
wee
hand
seemed
to
lead
me
down
the
right
path
as
nothing
else
had
ever
done
a
word
i
turned
over
a
new
leaf
and
did
my
best
to
make
up
for
the
past
was
going
well
when
laid
his
grip
upon
me
i
had
gone
up
to
town
about
an
investment
and
i
met
him
in
with
hardly
a
coat
to
his
back
or
a
boot
to
his
foot
we
are
says
he
touching
me
on
the
arm
we
ll
be
as
good
as
a
family
to
you
s
two
of
us
me
and
my
son
and
you
can
have
the
keeping
of
us
you
don
t
it
s
a
fine
law
abiding
country
is
and
there
s
always
a
policeman
within
hail
down
they
came
to
the
west
country
there
was
no
shaking
them
off
and
there
they
have
lived
rent
free
on
my
best
land
ever
since
was
no
rest
for
me
no
peace
no
forgetfulness
turn
where
i
would
there
was
his
cunning
grinning
face
at
my
elbow
grew
worse
as
grew
up
for
he
soon
saw
i
was
more
afraid
of
her
knowing
my
past
than
of
the
police
he
wanted
he
must
have
and
whatever
it
was
i
gave
him
without
question
land
money
houses
until
at
last
he
asked
a
thing
which
i
could
not
give
asked
for
son
you
see
had
grown
up
and
so
had
my
girl
and
as
i
was
known
to
be
in
weak
health
it
seemed
a
fine
stroke
to
him
that
his
lad
should
step
into
the
whole
property
there
i
was
firm
i
would
not
have
his
cursed
stock
mixed
with
mine
not
that
i
had
any
dislike
to
the
lad
but
his
blood
was
in
him
and
that
was
enough
i
stood
firm
threatened
i
braved
him
to
do
his
worst
were
to
meet
at
the
pool
midway
between
our
houses
to
talk
it
over
i
went
down
there
i
found
him
talking
with
his
son
so
i
smoked
a
cigar
and
waited
behind
a
tree
until
he
should
be
alone
as
i
listened
to
his
talk
all
that
was
black
and
bitter
in
me
seemed
to
come
uppermost
was
urging
his
son
to
marry
my
daughter
with
as
little
regard
for
what
she
might
think
as
if
she
were
a
slut
from
off
the
streets
drove
me
mad
to
think
that
i
and
all
that
i
held
most
dear
should
be
in
the
power
of
such
a
man
as
this
i
not
snap
the
bond
i
was
already
a
dying
and
a
desperate
man
clear
of
mind
and
fairly
strong
of
limb
i
knew
that
my
own
fate
was
sealed
my
memory
and
my
girl
could
be
saved
if
i
could
but
silence
that
foul
tongue
i
did
it
i
would
do
it
again
as
i
have
sinned
i
have
led
a
life
of
martyrdom
to
atone
for
it
that
my
girl
should
be
entangled
in
the
same
meshes
which
held
me
was
more
than
i
could
suffer
i
struck
him
down
with
no
more
compunction
than
if
he
had
been
some
foul
and
venomous
beast
cry
brought
back
his
son
but
i
had
gained
the
cover
of
the
wood
though
i
was
forced
to
go
back
to
fetch
the
cloak
which
i
had
dropped
in
my
flight
is
the
true
story
gentlemen
of
all
that
occurred
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
you
said
as
the
old
man
signed
the
statement
which
had
been
drawn
out
i
pray
that
we
may
never
be
exposed
to
such
a
temptation
i
pray
not
sir
what
do
you
intend
to
do
view
of
your
health
nothing
are
yourself
aware
that
you
will
soon
have
to
answer
for
your
deed
at
a
higher
court
than
the
i
will
keep
your
confession
and
if
is
condemned
i
shall
be
forced
to
use
it
not
it
shall
never
be
seen
by
mortal
eye
and
your
secret
whether
you
be
alive
or
dead
shall
be
safe
with
us
then
said
the
old
man
solemnly
own
deathbeds
when
they
come
will
be
the
easier
for
the
thought
of
the
peace
which
you
have
given
to
mine
and
shaking
in
all
his
giant
frame
he
stumbled
slowly
from
the
room
help
us
said
after
a
long
silence
does
fate
play
such
tricks
with
poor
helpless
worms
i
never
hear
of
such
a
case
as
this
that
i
do
not
think
of
s
words
and
say
but
for
the
grace
of
goes
was
acquitted
at
the
on
the
strength
of
a
number
of
objections
which
had
been
drawn
out
by
and
submitted
to
the
defending
counsel
lived
for
seven
months
after
our
interview
but
he
is
now
dead
and
there
is
every
prospect
that
the
son
and
daughter
may
come
to
live
happily
together
in
ignorance
of
the
black
cloud
which
rests
upon
their
past
adventure
v
the
five
orange
pips
i
glance
over
my
notes
and
records
of
the
cases
between
the
years
and
i
am
faced
by
so
many
which
present
strange
and
interesting
features
that
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
know
which
to
choose
and
which
to
leave
however
have
already
gained
publicity
through
the
papers
and
others
have
not
offered
a
field
for
those
peculiar
qualities
which
my
friend
possessed
in
so
high
a
degree
and
which
it
is
the
object
of
these
papers
to
illustrate
too
have
baffled
his
analytical
skill
and
would
be
as
narratives
beginnings
without
an
ending
while
others
have
been
but
partially
cleared
up
and
have
their
explanations
founded
rather
upon
conjecture
and
surmise
than
on
that
absolute
logical
proof
which
was
so
dear
to
him
is
however
one
of
these
last
which
was
so
remarkable
in
its
details
and
so
startling
in
its
results
that
i
am
tempted
to
give
some
account
of
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
are
points
in
connection
with
it
which
never
have
been
and
probably
never
will
be
entirely
cleared
up
year
furnished
us
with
a
long
series
of
cases
of
greater
or
less
interest
of
which
i
retain
the
records
my
headings
under
this
one
twelve
months
i
find
an
account
of
the
adventure
of
the
of
the
who
held
a
luxurious
club
in
the
lower
vault
of
a
furniture
warehouse
of
the
facts
connected
with
the
loss
of
the
barque
of
the
singular
adventures
of
the
in
the
island
of
and
finally
of
the
poisoning
case
the
latter
as
may
be
remembered
was
able
by
winding
up
the
dead
man
s
watch
to
prove
that
it
had
been
wound
up
two
hours
before
and
that
therefore
the
deceased
had
gone
to
bed
within
that
time
a
deduction
which
was
of
the
greatest
importance
in
clearing
up
the
case
these
i
may
sketch
out
at
some
future
date
but
none
of
them
present
such
singular
features
as
the
strange
train
of
circumstances
which
i
have
now
taken
up
my
pen
to
describe
was
in
the
latter
days
of
and
the
equinoctial
gales
had
set
in
with
exceptional
violence
day
the
wind
had
screamed
and
the
rain
had
beaten
against
the
windows
so
that
even
here
in
the
heart
of
great
hand
made
we
were
forced
to
raise
our
minds
for
the
instant
from
the
routine
of
life
and
to
recognise
the
presence
of
those
great
elemental
forces
which
shriek
at
mankind
through
the
bars
of
his
civilisation
like
untamed
beasts
in
a
cage
evening
drew
in
the
storm
grew
higher
and
louder
and
the
wind
cried
and
sobbed
like
a
child
in
the
chimney
sat
moodily
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
cross
indexing
his
records
of
crime
while
i
at
the
other
was
deep
in
one
of
s
fine
sea
stories
until
the
howl
of
the
gale
from
without
seemed
to
blend
with
the
text
and
the
splash
of
the
rain
to
lengthen
out
into
the
long
swash
of
the
sea
waves
wife
was
on
a
visit
to
her
mother
s
and
for
a
few
days
i
was
a
dweller
once
more
in
my
old
quarters
at
said
i
glancing
up
at
my
companion
that
was
surely
the
bell
could
come
to
night
friend
of
yours
perhaps
yourself
i
have
none
he
answered
i
do
not
encourage
visitors
a
client
then
so
it
is
a
serious
case
less
would
bring
a
man
out
on
such
a
day
and
at
such
an
hour
i
take
it
that
it
is
more
likely
to
be
some
crony
of
the
landlady
s
was
wrong
in
his
conjecture
however
for
there
came
a
step
in
the
passage
and
a
tapping
at
the
door
stretched
out
his
long
arm
to
turn
the
lamp
away
from
himself
and
towards
the
vacant
chair
upon
which
a
newcomer
must
sit
in
said
he
man
who
entered
was
young
some
two
and
twenty
at
the
outside
well
groomed
and
trimly
clad
with
something
of
refinement
and
delicacy
in
his
bearing
streaming
umbrella
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
his
long
shining
waterproof
told
of
the
fierce
weather
through
which
he
had
come
looked
about
him
anxiously
in
the
glare
of
the
lamp
and
i
could
see
that
his
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
heavy
like
those
of
a
man
who
is
weighed
down
with
some
great
anxiety
i
owe
you
an
apology
he
said
raising
his
golden
pince
nez
to
his
eyes
i
trust
that
i
am
not
intruding
i
fear
that
i
have
brought
some
traces
of
the
storm
and
rain
into
your
snug
chamber
me
your
coat
and
umbrella
said
may
rest
here
on
the
hook
and
will
be
dry
presently
have
come
up
from
the
south
west
i
see
from
clay
and
chalk
mixture
which
i
see
upon
your
toe
caps
is
quite
distinctive
i
have
come
for
advice
is
easily
got
help
is
not
always
so
easy
i
have
heard
of
you
i
heard
from
how
you
saved
him
in
the
scandal
of
course
was
wrongfully
accused
of
cheating
at
cards
said
that
you
could
solve
anything
said
too
much
you
are
never
beaten
i
have
been
beaten
four
times
three
times
by
men
and
once
by
a
woman
what
is
that
compared
with
the
number
of
your
successes
is
true
that
i
have
been
generally
successful
you
may
be
so
with
me
i
beg
that
you
will
draw
your
chair
up
to
the
fire
and
favour
me
with
some
details
as
to
your
case
is
no
ordinary
one
of
those
which
come
to
me
are
i
am
the
last
court
of
appeal
yet
i
question
sir
whether
in
all
your
experience
you
have
ever
listened
to
a
more
mysterious
and
inexplicable
chain
of
events
than
those
which
have
happened
in
my
own
family
fill
me
with
interest
said
give
us
the
essential
facts
from
the
commencement
and
i
can
afterwards
question
you
as
to
those
details
which
seem
to
me
to
be
most
important
young
man
pulled
his
chair
up
and
pushed
his
wet
feet
out
towards
the
blaze
name
said
he
is
but
my
own
affairs
have
as
far
as
i
can
understand
little
to
do
with
this
awful
business
is
a
hereditary
matter
so
in
order
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
facts
i
must
go
back
to
the
commencement
of
the
affair
must
know
that
my
grandfather
had
two
sons
my
uncle
and
my
father
father
had
a
small
factory
at
which
he
enlarged
at
the
time
of
the
invention
of
bicycling
was
a
patentee
of
the
unbreakable
tire
and
his
business
met
with
such
success
that
he
was
able
to
sell
it
and
to
retire
upon
a
handsome
competence
uncle
emigrated
to
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
became
a
planter
in
where
he
was
reported
to
have
done
very
well
the
time
of
the
war
he
fought
in
s
army
and
afterwards
under
where
he
rose
to
be
a
colonel
laid
down
his
arms
my
uncle
returned
to
his
plantation
where
he
remained
for
three
or
four
years
or
he
came
back
to
and
took
a
small
estate
in
near
had
made
a
very
considerable
fortune
in
the
and
his
reason
for
leaving
them
was
his
aversion
to
the
negroes
and
his
dislike
of
the
policy
in
extending
the
franchise
to
them
was
a
singular
man
fierce
and
quick
tempered
very
foul
mouthed
when
he
was
angry
and
of
a
most
retiring
disposition
all
the
years
that
he
lived
at
i
doubt
if
ever
he
set
foot
in
the
town
had
a
garden
and
two
or
three
fields
round
his
house
and
there
he
would
take
his
exercise
though
very
often
for
weeks
on
end
he
would
never
leave
his
room
drank
a
great
deal
of
brandy
and
smoked
very
heavily
but
he
would
see
no
society
and
did
not
want
any
friends
not
even
his
own
brother
didn
t
mind
me
in
fact
he
took
a
fancy
to
me
for
at
the
time
when
he
saw
me
first
i
was
a
youngster
of
twelve
or
so
would
be
in
the
year
after
he
had
been
eight
or
nine
years
in
begged
my
father
to
let
me
live
with
him
and
he
was
very
kind
to
me
in
his
way
he
was
sober
he
used
to
be
fond
of
playing
backgammon
and
draughts
with
me
and
he
would
make
me
his
representative
both
with
the
servants
and
with
the
tradespeople
so
that
by
the
time
that
i
was
sixteen
i
was
quite
master
of
the
house
i
kept
all
the
keys
and
could
go
where
i
liked
and
do
what
i
liked
so
long
as
i
did
not
disturb
him
in
his
privacy
was
one
singular
exception
however
for
he
had
a
single
room
a
lumber
room
up
among
the
attics
which
was
invariably
locked
and
which
he
would
never
permit
either
me
or
anyone
else
to
enter
a
boy
s
curiosity
i
have
peeped
through
the
keyhole
but
i
was
never
able
to
see
more
than
such
a
collection
of
old
trunks
and
bundles
as
would
be
expected
in
such
a
room
day
it
was
in
a
letter
with
a
foreign
stamp
lay
upon
the
table
in
front
of
the
colonel
s
plate
was
not
a
common
thing
for
him
to
receive
letters
for
his
bills
were
all
paid
in
ready
money
and
he
had
no
friends
of
any
sort
said
he
as
he
took
it
up
postmark
can
this
be
it
hurriedly
out
there
jumped
five
little
dried
orange
pips
which
pattered
down
upon
his
plate
i
began
to
laugh
at
this
but
the
laugh
was
struck
from
my
lips
at
the
sight
of
his
face
lip
had
fallen
his
eyes
were
protruding
his
skin
the
colour
of
putty
and
he
glared
at
the
envelope
which
he
still
held
in
his
trembling
hand
k
k
k
he
shrieked
and
then
my
my
sins
have
overtaken
me
is
it
uncle
i
cried
said
he
and
rising
from
the
table
he
retired
to
his
room
leaving
me
palpitating
with
horror
i
took
up
the
envelope
and
saw
scrawled
in
red
ink
upon
the
inner
flap
just
above
the
gum
the
letter
k
three
times
repeated
was
nothing
else
save
the
five
dried
pips
could
be
the
reason
of
his
overpowering
terror
i
left
the
breakfast
table
and
as
i
ascended
the
stair
i
met
him
coming
down
with
an
old
rusty
key
which
must
have
belonged
to
the
attic
in
one
hand
and
a
small
brass
box
like
a
cashbox
in
the
other
may
do
what
they
like
but
i
ll
checkmate
them
still
said
he
with
an
oath
that
i
shall
want
a
fire
in
my
room
to
day
and
send
down
to
the
lawyer
i
did
as
he
ordered
and
when
the
lawyer
arrived
i
was
asked
to
step
up
to
the
room
fire
was
burning
brightly
and
in
the
grate
there
was
a
mass
of
black
fluffy
ashes
as
of
burned
paper
while
the
brass
box
stood
open
and
empty
beside
it
i
glanced
at
the
box
i
noticed
with
a
start
that
upon
the
lid
was
printed
the
treble
k
which
i
had
read
in
the
morning
upon
the
envelope
i
wish
you
said
my
uncle
to
witness
my
will
i
leave
my
estate
with
all
its
advantages
and
all
its
disadvantages
to
my
brother
your
father
whence
it
will
no
doubt
descend
to
you
you
can
enjoy
it
in
peace
well
and
good
you
find
you
cannot
take
my
advice
my
boy
and
leave
it
to
your
deadliest
enemy
i
am
sorry
to
give
you
such
a
two
edged
thing
but
i
can
t
say
what
turn
things
are
going
to
take
sign
the
paper
where
shows
you
i
signed
the
paper
as
directed
and
the
lawyer
took
it
away
with
him
singular
incident
made
as
you
may
think
the
deepest
impression
upon
me
and
i
pondered
over
it
and
turned
it
every
way
in
my
mind
without
being
able
to
make
anything
of
it
i
could
not
shake
off
the
vague
feeling
of
dread
which
it
left
behind
though
the
sensation
grew
less
keen
as
the
weeks
passed
and
nothing
happened
to
disturb
the
usual
routine
of
our
lives
i
could
see
a
change
in
my
uncle
however
drank
more
than
ever
and
he
was
less
inclined
for
any
sort
of
society
of
his
time
he
would
spend
in
his
room
with
the
door
locked
upon
the
inside
but
sometimes
he
would
emerge
in
a
sort
of
drunken
frenzy
and
would
burst
out
of
the
house
and
tear
about
the
garden
with
a
revolver
in
his
hand
screaming
out
that
he
was
afraid
of
no
man
and
that
he
was
not
to
be
cooped
up
like
a
sheep
in
a
pen
by
man
or
devil
these
hot
fits
were
over
however
he
would
rush
tumultuously
in
at
the
door
and
lock
and
bar
it
behind
him
like
a
man
who
can
brazen
it
out
no
longer
against
the
terror
which
lies
at
the
roots
of
his
soul
such
times
i
have
seen
his
face
even
on
a
cold
day
glisten
with
moisture
as
though
it
were
new
raised
from
a
basin
to
come
to
an
end
of
the
matter
and
not
to
abuse
your
patience
there
came
a
night
when
he
made
one
of
those
drunken
sallies
from
which
he
never
came
back
found
him
when
we
went
to
search
for
him
face
downward
in
a
little
green
scummed
pool
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
was
no
sign
of
any
violence
and
the
water
was
but
two
feet
deep
so
that
the
jury
having
regard
to
his
known
eccentricity
brought
in
a
verdict
of
suicide
i
who
knew
how
he
winced
from
the
very
thought
of
death
had
much
ado
to
persuade
myself
that
he
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
meet
it
matter
passed
however
and
my
father
entered
into
possession
of
the
estate
and
of
some
pounds
which
lay
to
his
credit
at
the
bank
moment
interposed
your
statement
is
i
foresee
one
of
the
most
remarkable
to
which
i
have
ever
listened
me
have
the
date
of
the
reception
by
your
uncle
of
the
letter
and
the
date
of
his
supposed
suicide
letter
arrived
on
death
was
seven
weeks
later
upon
the
night
of
nd
you
proceed
my
father
took
over
the
property
he
at
my
request
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
attic
which
had
been
always
locked
up
found
the
brass
box
there
although
its
contents
had
been
destroyed
the
inside
of
the
cover
was
a
paper
label
with
the
initials
of
k
k
k
repeated
upon
it
and
memoranda
receipts
and
a
register
written
beneath
we
presume
indicated
the
nature
of
the
papers
which
had
been
destroyed
by
the
rest
there
was
nothing
of
much
importance
in
the
attic
save
a
great
many
scattered
papers
and
note
books
bearing
upon
my
uncle
s
life
in
of
them
were
of
the
war
time
and
showed
that
he
had
done
his
duty
well
and
had
borne
the
repute
of
a
brave
soldier
were
of
a
date
during
the
reconstruction
of
the
states
and
were
mostly
concerned
with
politics
for
he
had
evidently
taken
a
strong
part
in
opposing
the
carpet
bag
politicians
who
had
been
sent
down
from
the
it
was
the
beginning
of
when
my
father
came
to
live
at
and
all
went
as
well
as
possible
with
us
until
the
of
the
fourth
day
after
the
new
year
i
heard
my
father
give
a
sharp
cry
of
surprise
as
we
sat
together
at
the
breakfast
table
he
was
sitting
with
a
newly
opened
envelope
in
one
hand
and
five
dried
orange
pips
in
the
outstretched
palm
of
the
other
one
had
always
laughed
at
what
he
called
my
cock
and
bull
story
about
the
colonel
but
he
looked
very
scared
and
puzzled
now
that
the
same
thing
had
come
upon
himself
what
on
earth
does
this
mean
he
stammered
heart
had
turned
to
lead
is
k
k
k
said
i
looked
inside
the
envelope
it
is
he
cried
are
the
very
letters
what
is
this
written
above
them
the
papers
on
the
sundial
i
read
peeping
over
his
shoulder
papers
sundial
he
asked
sundial
in
the
garden
is
no
other
said
i
but
the
papers
must
be
those
that
are
destroyed
said
he
gripping
hard
at
his
courage
are
in
a
civilised
land
here
and
we
can
t
have
tomfoolery
of
this
kind
does
the
thing
come
from
i
answered
glancing
at
the
postmark
preposterous
practical
joke
said
he
have
i
to
do
with
sundials
and
papers
i
shall
take
no
notice
of
such
nonsense
i
should
certainly
speak
to
the
police
i
said
be
laughed
at
for
my
pains
of
the
sort
let
me
do
so
i
forbid
you
i
won
t
have
a
fuss
made
about
such
nonsense
was
in
vain
to
argue
with
him
for
he
was
a
very
obstinate
man
i
went
about
however
with
a
heart
which
was
full
of
forebodings
the
third
day
after
the
coming
of
the
letter
my
father
went
from
home
to
visit
an
old
friend
of
his
who
is
in
command
of
one
of
the
forts
upon
i
was
glad
that
he
should
go
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
farther
from
danger
when
he
was
away
from
home
that
however
i
was
in
error
the
second
day
of
his
absence
i
received
a
telegram
from
the
major
imploring
me
to
come
at
once
father
had
fallen
over
one
of
the
deep
chalk
pits
which
abound
in
the
neighbourhood
and
was
lying
senseless
with
a
shattered
skull
i
hurried
to
him
but
he
passed
away
without
having
ever
recovered
his
consciousness
had
as
it
appears
been
returning
from
in
the
twilight
and
as
the
country
was
unknown
to
him
and
the
chalk
pit
unfenced
the
jury
had
no
hesitation
in
bringing
in
a
verdict
of
death
from
accidental
causes
as
i
examined
every
fact
connected
with
his
death
i
was
unable
to
find
anything
which
could
suggest
the
idea
of
murder
were
no
signs
of
violence
no
footmarks
no
robbery
no
record
of
strangers
having
been
seen
upon
the
roads
yet
i
need
not
tell
you
that
my
mind
was
far
from
at
ease
and
that
i
was
well
nigh
certain
that
some
foul
plot
had
been
woven
round
him
this
sinister
way
i
came
into
my
inheritance
will
ask
me
why
i
did
not
dispose
of
it
i
answer
because
i
was
well
convinced
that
our
troubles
were
in
some
way
dependent
upon
an
incident
in
my
uncle
s
life
and
that
the
danger
would
be
as
pressing
in
one
house
as
in
another
was
in
that
my
poor
father
met
his
end
and
two
years
and
eight
months
have
elapsed
since
then
that
time
i
have
lived
happily
at
and
i
had
begun
to
hope
that
this
curse
had
passed
away
from
the
family
and
that
it
had
ended
with
the
last
generation
i
had
begun
to
take
comfort
too
soon
however
yesterday
morning
the
blow
fell
in
the
very
shape
in
which
it
had
come
upon
my
father
young
man
took
from
his
waistcoat
a
crumpled
envelope
and
turning
to
the
table
he
shook
out
upon
it
five
little
dried
orange
pips
is
the
envelope
he
continued
postmark
is
eastern
division
are
the
very
words
which
were
upon
my
father
s
last
message
k
k
k
and
then
the
papers
on
the
sundial
have
you
done
asked
tell
the
truth
he
sank
his
face
into
his
thin
white
hands
i
have
felt
helpless
i
have
felt
like
one
of
those
poor
rabbits
when
the
snake
is
writhing
towards
it
i
seem
to
be
in
the
grasp
of
some
resistless
inexorable
evil
which
no
foresight
and
no
precautions
can
guard
against
tut
cried
must
act
man
or
you
are
lost
but
energy
can
save
you
is
no
time
for
despair
i
have
seen
the
police
they
listened
to
my
story
with
a
smile
i
am
convinced
that
the
inspector
has
formed
the
opinion
that
the
letters
are
all
practical
jokes
and
that
the
deaths
of
my
relations
were
really
accidents
as
the
jury
stated
and
were
not
to
be
connected
with
the
warnings
shook
his
clenched
hands
in
the
air
imbecility
he
cried
have
however
allowed
me
a
policeman
who
may
remain
in
the
house
with
me
he
come
with
you
to
night
orders
were
to
stay
in
the
house
raved
in
the
air
did
you
come
to
me
he
cried
and
above
all
why
did
you
not
come
at
once
i
did
not
know
was
only
to
day
that
i
spoke
to
about
my
troubles
and
was
advised
by
him
to
come
to
you
is
really
two
days
since
you
had
the
letter
should
have
acted
before
this
have
no
further
evidence
i
suppose
than
that
which
you
have
placed
before
us
no
suggestive
detail
which
might
help
us
is
one
thing
said
rummaged
in
his
coat
pocket
and
drawing
out
a
piece
of
discoloured
blue
tinted
paper
he
laid
it
out
upon
the
table
i
have
some
remembrance
said
he
that
on
the
day
when
my
uncle
burned
the
papers
i
observed
that
the
small
unburned
margins
which
lay
amid
the
ashes
were
of
this
particular
colour
i
found
this
single
sheet
upon
the
floor
of
his
room
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
may
be
one
of
the
papers
which
has
perhaps
fluttered
out
from
among
the
others
and
in
that
way
has
escaped
destruction
the
mention
of
pips
i
do
not
see
that
it
helps
us
much
i
think
myself
that
it
is
a
page
from
some
private
diary
writing
is
undoubtedly
my
uncle
s
moved
the
lamp
and
we
both
bent
over
the
sheet
of
paper
which
showed
by
its
ragged
edge
that
it
had
indeed
been
torn
from
a
book
was
headed
and
beneath
were
the
following
enigmatical
notices
th
came
old
platform
th
the
pips
on
and
of
th
cleared
th
cleared
th
well
you
said
folding
up
the
paper
and
returning
it
to
our
visitor
now
you
must
on
no
account
lose
another
instant
cannot
spare
time
even
to
discuss
what
you
have
told
me
must
get
home
instantly
and
act
shall
i
do
is
but
one
thing
to
do
must
be
done
at
once
must
put
this
piece
of
paper
which
you
have
shown
us
into
the
brass
box
which
you
have
described
must
also
put
in
a
note
to
say
that
all
the
other
papers
were
burned
by
your
uncle
and
that
this
is
the
only
one
which
remains
must
assert
that
in
such
words
as
will
carry
conviction
with
them
done
this
you
must
at
once
put
the
box
out
upon
the
sundial
as
directed
you
understand
not
think
of
revenge
or
anything
of
the
sort
at
present
i
think
that
we
may
gain
that
by
means
of
the
law
but
we
have
our
web
to
weave
while
theirs
is
already
woven
first
consideration
is
to
remove
the
pressing
danger
which
threatens
you
second
is
to
clear
up
the
mystery
and
to
punish
the
guilty
parties
i
thank
you
said
the
young
man
rising
and
pulling
on
his
overcoat
have
given
me
fresh
life
and
hope
i
shall
certainly
do
as
you
advise
not
lose
an
instant
above
all
take
care
of
yourself
in
the
meanwhile
for
i
do
not
think
that
there
can
be
a
doubt
that
you
are
threatened
by
a
very
real
and
imminent
danger
do
you
go
back
train
from
is
not
yet
nine
streets
will
be
crowded
so
i
trust
that
you
may
be
in
safety
yet
you
cannot
guard
yourself
too
closely
i
am
armed
is
well
morrow
i
shall
set
to
work
upon
your
case
i
shall
see
you
at
then
your
secret
lies
in
is
there
that
i
shall
seek
it
i
shall
call
upon
you
in
a
day
or
in
two
days
with
news
as
to
the
box
and
the
papers
i
shall
take
your
advice
in
every
particular
shook
hands
with
us
and
took
his
leave
the
wind
still
screamed
and
the
rain
splashed
and
pattered
against
the
windows
strange
wild
story
seemed
to
have
come
to
us
from
amid
the
mad
elements
blown
in
upon
us
like
a
sheet
of
sea
weed
in
a
gale
and
now
to
have
been
reabsorbed
by
them
once
more
sat
for
some
time
in
silence
with
his
head
sunk
forward
and
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
he
lit
his
pipe
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
watched
the
blue
smoke
rings
as
they
chased
each
other
up
to
the
ceiling
i
think
he
remarked
at
last
that
of
all
our
cases
we
have
had
none
more
fantastic
than
this
perhaps
the
of
yes
perhaps
that
yet
this
seems
to
me
to
be
walking
amid
even
greater
perils
than
did
the
have
you
i
asked
formed
any
definite
conception
as
to
what
these
perils
are
can
be
no
question
as
to
their
nature
he
answered
what
are
they
is
this
k
k
k
and
why
does
he
pursue
this
unhappy
family
closed
his
eyes
and
placed
his
elbows
upon
the
arms
of
his
chair
with
his
finger
tips
together
ideal
reasoner
he
remarked
would
when
he
had
once
been
shown
a
single
fact
in
all
its
bearings
deduce
from
it
not
only
all
the
chain
of
events
which
led
up
to
it
but
also
all
the
results
which
would
follow
from
it
could
correctly
describe
a
whole
animal
by
the
contemplation
of
a
single
bone
so
the
observer
who
has
thoroughly
understood
one
link
in
a
series
of
incidents
should
be
able
to
accurately
state
all
the
other
ones
both
before
and
after
have
not
yet
grasped
the
results
which
the
reason
alone
can
attain
to
may
be
solved
in
the
study
which
have
baffled
all
those
who
have
sought
a
solution
by
the
aid
of
their
senses
carry
the
art
however
to
its
highest
pitch
it
is
necessary
that
the
reasoner
should
be
able
to
utilise
all
the
facts
which
have
come
to
his
knowledge
and
this
in
itself
implies
as
you
will
readily
see
a
possession
of
all
knowledge
which
even
in
these
days
of
free
education
and
encyclopaedias
is
a
somewhat
rare
accomplishment
is
not
so
impossible
however
that
a
man
should
possess
all
knowledge
which
is
likely
to
be
useful
to
him
in
his
work
and
this
i
have
endeavoured
in
my
case
to
do
i
remember
rightly
you
on
one
occasion
in
the
early
days
of
our
friendship
defined
my
limits
in
a
very
precise
fashion
i
answered
laughing
was
a
singular
document
astronomy
and
politics
were
marked
at
zero
i
remember
variable
geology
profound
as
regards
the
mud
stains
from
any
region
within
fifty
miles
of

chemistry
eccentric

unsystematic
sensational

records
unique
violin

swordsman
lawyer
and
self
poisoner
by
cocaine
and
tobacco
i
think
were
the
main
points
of
my
analysis
grinned
at
the
last
item
he
said
i
say
now
as
i
said
then
that
a
man
should
keep
his
little
brain
attic
stocked
with
all
the
furniture
that
he
is
likely
to
use
and
the
rest
he
can
put
away
in
the
lumber
room
of
his
library
where
he
can
get
it
if
he
wants
it
for
such
a
case
as
the
one
which
has
been
submitted
to
us
to
night
we
need
certainly
to
muster
all
our
resources
hand
me
down
the
letter
k
of
the
which
stands
upon
the
shelf
beside
you
you
let
us
consider
the
situation
and
see
what
may
be
deduced
from
it
the
first
place
we
may
start
with
a
strong
presumption
that
had
some
very
strong
reason
for
leaving
at
his
time
of
life
do
not
change
all
their
habits
and
exchange
willingly
the
charming
climate
of
for
the
lonely
life
of
an
provincial
town
extreme
love
of
solitude
in
suggests
the
idea
that
he
was
in
fear
of
someone
or
something
so
we
may
assume
as
a
working
hypothesis
that
it
was
fear
of
someone
or
something
which
drove
him
from
to
what
it
was
he
feared
we
can
only
deduce
that
by
considering
the
formidable
letters
which
were
received
by
himself
and
his
successors
you
remark
the
postmarks
of
those
letters
first
was
from
the
second
from
and
the
third
from
do
you
deduce
from
that
are
all
seaports
the
writer
was
on
board
of
a
ship
have
already
a
clue
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
probability
the
strong
probability
is
that
the
writer
was
on
board
of
a
ship
now
let
us
consider
another
point
the
case
of
seven
weeks
elapsed
between
the
threat
and
its
fulfilment
in
it
was
only
some
three
or
four
days
that
suggest
anything
a
greater
distance
to
travel
the
letter
had
also
a
greater
distance
to
come
i
do
not
see
the
point
is
at
least
a
presumption
that
the
vessel
in
which
the
man
or
men
are
is
a
sailing
ship
looks
as
if
they
always
send
their
singular
warning
or
token
before
them
when
starting
upon
their
mission
see
how
quickly
the
deed
followed
the
sign
when
it
came
from
they
had
come
from
in
a
steamer
they
would
have
arrived
almost
as
soon
as
their
letter
as
a
matter
of
fact
seven
weeks
elapsed
i
think
that
those
seven
weeks
represented
the
difference
between
the
mail
boat
which
brought
the
letter
and
the
sailing
vessel
which
brought
the
writer
is
possible
than
that
is
probable
now
you
see
the
deadly
urgency
of
this
new
case
and
why
i
urged
young
to
caution
blow
has
always
fallen
at
the
end
of
the
time
which
it
would
take
the
senders
to
travel
the
distance
this
one
comes
from
and
therefore
we
cannot
count
upon
delay
i
cried
can
it
mean
this
relentless
persecution
papers
which
carried
are
obviously
of
vital
importance
to
the
person
or
persons
in
the
sailing
ship
i
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
there
must
be
more
than
one
of
them
a
single
man
could
not
have
carried
out
two
deaths
in
such
a
way

society
was
formed
by
some
ex
soldiers
in
the
states
after
the
and
it
rapidly
formed
local
branches
in
different
parts
of
the
country
notably
in
the
and
power

used
for
political
purposes
principally
for
the
terrorising
of
the

murdering
and
driving
from
the
country
of
those
who
were
opposed
to

outrages
were
usually
preceded
by
a
warning
sent
to
the
marked

fantastic

generally
recognised

unfailingly
come
upon
him
and
usually
in
some
strange
and
unforeseen
manner
perfect
was
the
organisation
of
the
society
and
so
systematic
its
methods
that
there
is
hardly
a
case
upon
record
where
any
man
succeeded
in
braving
it
with
impunity
or
in
which
any
of
its
outrages
were
traced
home
to
the
perpetrators
some
years
the
organisation
flourished
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
government
and
of
the
better
classes
of
the
community
in
the
in
the
year
the
movement
rather
suddenly
collapsed
although
there
have
been
sporadic
outbreaks
of
the
same
sort
since
that
date
will
observe
said
laying
down
the
volume
that
the
sudden
breaking
up
of
the
society
was
coincident
with
the
disappearance
of
from
with
their
papers
may
well
have
been
cause
and
effect
is
no
wonder
that
he
and
his
family
have
some
of
the
more
implacable
spirits
upon
their
track
can
understand
that
this
register
and
diary
may
implicate
some
of
the
first
men
in
the
and
that
there
may
be
many
who
will
not
sleep
easy
at
night
until
it
is
recovered
the
page
we
have
seen
such
as
we
might
expect
ran
if
i
remember
right
sent
the
pips
to
a
b
and

that
is
sent
the
society
s
warning
to
them
there
are
successive
entries
that
a
and
b
cleared
or
left
the
country
and
finally
that
c
was
visited
with
i
fear
a
sinister
result
for
c
i
think
that
we
may
let
some
light
into
this
dark
place
and
i
believe
that
the
only
chance
young
has
in
the
meantime
is
to
do
what
i
have
told
him
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
or
to
be
done
to
night
so
hand
me
over
my
violin
and
let
us
try
to
forget
for
half
an
hour
the
miserable
weather
and
the
still
more
miserable
ways
of
our
fellow
men
had
cleared
in
the
morning
and
the
sun
was
shining
with
a
subdued
brightness
through
the
dim
veil
which
hangs
over
the
great
city
was
already
at
breakfast
when
i
came
down
will
excuse
me
for
not
waiting
for
you
said
he
i
have
i
foresee
a
very
busy
day
before
me
in
looking
into
this
case
of
young
s
steps
will
you
take
i
asked
will
very
much
depend
upon
the
results
of
my
first
inquiries
i
may
have
to
go
down
to
after
all
will
not
go
there
first
i
shall
commence
with
the
ring
the
bell
and
the
maid
will
bring
up
your
coffee
i
waited
i
lifted
the
unopened
newspaper
from
the
table
and
glanced
my
eye
over
it
rested
upon
a
heading
which
sent
a
chill
to
my
heart
i
cried
you
are
too
late
said
he
laying
down
his
cup
i
feared
as
much
was
it
done
spoke
calmly
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
deeply
moved
eye
caught
the
name
of
and
the
heading
is
the
account
nine
and
ten
last
night
of
the
h
on
duty
near
heard
a
cry
for
help
and
a
splash
in
the
water
night
however
was
extremely
dark
and
stormy
so
that
in
spite
of
the
help
of
several
passers
by
it
was
quite
impossible
to
effect
a
rescue
alarm
however
was
given
and
by
the
aid
of
the
water
police
the
body
was
eventually
recovered
proved
to
be
that
of
a
young
gentleman
whose
name
as
it
appears
from
an
envelope
which
was
found
in
his
pocket
was
and
whose
residence
is
near
is
conjectured
that
he
may
have
been
hurrying
down
to
catch
the
last
train
from
and
that
in
his
haste
and
the
extreme
darkness
he
missed
his
path
and
walked
over
the
edge
of
one
of
the
small
landing
places
for
river
steamboats
body
exhibited
no
traces
of
violence
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
deceased
had
been
the
victim
of
an
unfortunate
accident
which
should
have
the
effect
of
calling
the
attention
of
the
authorities
to
the
condition
of
the
riverside
landing
stages
sat
in
silence
for
some
minutes
more
depressed
and
shaken
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
hurts
my
pride
he
said
at
last
is
a
petty
feeling
no
doubt
but
it
hurts
my
pride
becomes
a
personal
matter
with
me
now
and
if
sends
me
health
i
shall
set
my
hand
upon
this
gang
he
should
come
to
me
for
help
and
that
i
should
send
him
away
to
his
death
sprang
from
his
chair
and
paced
about
the
room
in
uncontrollable
agitation
with
a
flush
upon
his
sallow
cheeks
and
a
nervous
clasping
and
unclasping
of
his
long
thin
hands
must
be
cunning
devils
he
exclaimed
at
last
could
they
have
decoyed
him
down
there
is
not
on
the
direct
line
to
the
station
bridge
no
doubt
was
too
crowded
even
on
such
a
night
for
their
purpose
we
shall
see
who
will
win
in
the
long
run
i
am
going
out
now
the
police
i
shall
be
my
own
police
i
have
spun
the
web
they
may
take
the
flies
but
not
before
day
i
was
engaged
in
my
professional
work
and
it
was
late
in
the
evening
before
i
returned
to
had
not
come
back
yet
was
nearly
ten
o
clock
before
he
entered
looking
pale
and
worn
walked
up
to
the
sideboard
and
tearing
a
piece
from
the
loaf
he
devoured
it
voraciously
washing
it
down
with
a
long
draught
of
water
are
hungry
i
remarked
had
escaped
my
memory
i
have
had
nothing
since
breakfast
a
bite
i
had
no
time
to
think
of
it
how
have
you
succeeded
have
a
clue
i
have
them
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
shall
not
long
remain
unavenged
let
us
put
their
own
devilish
trade
mark
upon
them
is
well
thought
of
do
you
mean
took
an
orange
from
the
cupboard
and
tearing
it
to
pieces
he
squeezed
out
the
pips
upon
the
table
these
he
took
five
and
thrust
them
into
an
envelope
the
inside
of
the
flap
he
wrote
s
h
for
j
o
he
sealed
it
and
addressed
it
to
will
await
him
when
he
enters
port
said
he
chuckling
may
give
him
a
sleepless
night
will
find
it
as
sure
a
precursor
of
his
fate
as
did
before
him
who
is
this
leader
of
the
gang
i
shall
have
the
others
but
he
first
did
you
trace
it
then
took
a
large
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pocket
all
covered
with
dates
and
names
i
have
spent
the
whole
day
said
he
over
s
registers
and
files
of
the
old
papers
following
the
future
career
of
every
vessel
which
touched
at
in
and
in
were
thirty
six
ships
of
fair
tonnage
which
were
reported
there
during
those
months
these
one
the
instantly
attracted
my
attention
since
although
it
was
reported
as
having
cleared
from
the
name
is
that
which
is
given
to
one
of
the
states
of
the
i
think
i
was
not
and
am
not
sure
which
but
i
knew
that
the
ship
must
have
an
origin
then
i
searched
the
records
and
when
i
found
that
the
barque
was
there
in
my
suspicion
became
a
certainty
i
then
inquired
as
to
the
vessels
which
lay
at
present
in
the
port
of
had
arrived
here
last
week
i
went
down
to
the
and
found
that
she
had
been
taken
down
the
river
by
the
early
tide
this
morning
homeward
bound
to
i
wired
to
and
learned
that
she
had
passed
some
time
ago
and
as
the
wind
is
easterly
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
is
now
past
the
and
not
very
far
from
the
of
will
you
do
then
i
have
my
hand
upon
him
and
the
two
mates
are
as
i
learn
the
only
native
born
in
the
ship
others
are
and
i
know
also
that
they
were
all
three
away
from
the
ship
last
night
i
had
it
from
the
stevedore
who
has
been
loading
their
cargo
the
time
that
their
sailing
ship
reaches
the
mail
boat
will
have
carried
this
letter
and
the
cable
will
have
informed
the
police
of
that
these
three
gentlemen
are
badly
wanted
here
upon
a
charge
of
murder
is
ever
a
flaw
however
in
the
best
laid
of
human
plans
and
the
murderers
of
were
never
to
receive
the
orange
pips
which
would
show
them
that
another
as
cunning
and
as
resolute
as
themselves
was
upon
their
track
long
and
very
severe
were
the
equinoctial
gales
that
year
waited
long
for
news
of
the
of
but
none
ever
reached
us
did
at
last
hear
that
somewhere
far
out
in
the
a
shattered
stern
post
of
a
boat
was
seen
swinging
in
the
trough
of
a
wave
with
the
letters
l
s
carved
upon
it
and
that
is
all
which
we
shall
ever
know
of
the
fate
of
the
adventure
vi
the
man
with
the
twisted
lip
brother
of
the
late
d
d
of
the
of
s
was
much
addicted
to
opium
habit
grew
upon
him
as
i
understand
from
some
foolish
freak
when
he
was
at
college
for
having
read
s
description
of
his
dreams
and
sensations
he
had
drenched
his
tobacco
with
laudanum
in
an
attempt
to
produce
the
same
effects
found
as
so
many
more
have
done
that
the
practice
is
easier
to
attain
than
to
get
rid
of
and
for
many
years
he
continued
to
be
a
slave
to
the
drug
an
object
of
mingled
horror
and
pity
to
his
friends
and
relatives
i
can
see
him
now
with
yellow
pasty
face
drooping
lids
and
pin
point
pupils
all
huddled
in
a
chair
the
wreck
and
ruin
of
a
noble
man
night
it
was
in
there
came
a
ring
to
my
bell
about
the
hour
when
a
man
gives
his
first
yawn
and
glances
at
the
clock
i
sat
up
in
my
chair
and
my
wife
laid
her
needle
work
down
in
her
lap
and
made
a
little
face
of
disappointment
a
patient
said
she
ll
have
to
go
out
i
groaned
for
i
was
newly
come
back
from
a
weary
day
heard
the
door
open
a
few
hurried
words
and
then
quick
steps
upon
the
linoleum
own
door
flew
open
and
a
lady
clad
in
some
dark
coloured
stuff
with
a
black
veil
entered
the
room
will
excuse
my
calling
so
late
she
began
and
then
suddenly
losing
her
self
control
she
ran
forward
threw
her
arms
about
my
wife
s
neck
and
sobbed
upon
her
shoulder
i
m
in
such
trouble
she
cried
i
do
so
want
a
little
help
said
my
wife
pulling
up
her
veil
it
is
you
startled
me
i
had
not
an
idea
who
you
were
when
you
came
in
i
didn
t
know
what
to
do
so
i
came
straight
to
you
was
always
the
way
who
were
in
grief
came
to
my
wife
like
birds
to
a
light
house
was
very
sweet
of
you
to
come
you
must
have
some
wine
and
water
and
sit
here
comfortably
and
tell
us
all
about
it
should
you
rather
that
i
sent
off
to
bed
no
no
i
want
the
doctor
s
advice
and
help
too
s
about
has
not
been
home
for
two
days
i
am
so
frightened
about
him
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
spoken
to
us
of
her
husband
s
trouble
to
me
as
a
doctor
to
my
wife
as
an
old
friend
and
school
companion
soothed
and
comforted
her
by
such
words
as
we
could
find
she
know
where
her
husband
was
it
possible
that
we
could
bring
him
back
to
her
seems
that
it
was
had
the
surest
information
that
of
late
he
had
when
the
fit
was
on
him
made
use
of
an
opium
den
in
the
farthest
east
of
the
his
orgies
had
always
been
confined
to
one
day
and
he
had
come
back
twitching
and
shattered
in
the
evening
now
the
spell
had
been
upon
him
eight
and
forty
hours
and
he
lay
there
doubtless
among
the
dregs
of
the
docks
breathing
in
the
poison
or
sleeping
off
the
effects
he
was
to
be
found
she
was
sure
of
it
at
the
of
in
what
was
she
to
do
could
she
a
young
and
timid
woman
make
her
way
into
such
a
place
and
pluck
her
husband
out
from
among
the
ruffians
who
surrounded
him
was
the
case
and
of
course
there
was
but
one
way
out
of
it
i
not
escort
her
to
this
place
then
as
a
second
thought
why
should
she
come
at
all
i
was
s
medical
adviser
and
as
such
i
had
influence
over
him
i
could
manage
it
better
if
i
were
alone
i
promised
her
on
my
word
that
i
would
send
him
home
in
a
cab
within
two
hours
if
he
were
indeed
at
the
address
which
she
had
given
me
so
in
ten
minutes
i
had
left
my
armchair
and
cheery
sitting
room
behind
me
and
was
speeding
eastward
in
a
hansom
on
a
strange
errand
as
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
though
the
future
only
could
show
how
strange
it
was
to
be
there
was
no
great
difficulty
in
the
first
stage
of
my
adventure
is
a
vile
alley
lurking
behind
the
high
wharves
which
line
the
north
side
of
the
river
to
the
east
of
a
slop
shop
and
a
gin
shop
approached
by
a
steep
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
a
black
gap
like
the
mouth
of
a
cave
i
found
the
den
of
which
i
was
in
search
my
cab
to
wait
i
passed
down
the
steps
worn
hollow
in
the
centre
by
the
ceaseless
tread
of
drunken
feet
and
by
the
light
of
a
flickering
oil
lamp
above
the
door
i
found
the
latch
and
made
my
way
into
a
long
low
room
thick
and
heavy
with
the
brown
opium
smoke
and
terraced
with
wooden
berths
like
the
forecastle
of
an
emigrant
ship
the
gloom
one
could
dimly
catch
a
glimpse
of
bodies
lying
in
strange
fantastic
poses
bowed
shoulders
bent
knees
heads
thrown
back
and
chins
pointing
upward
with
here
and
there
a
dark
lack
lustre
eye
turned
upon
the
newcomer
of
the
black
shadows
there
glimmered
little
red
circles
of
light
now
bright
now
faint
as
the
burning
poison
waxed
or
waned
in
the
bowls
of
the
metal
pipes
most
lay
silent
but
some
muttered
to
themselves
and
others
talked
together
in
a
strange
low
monotonous
voice
their
conversation
coming
in
gushes
and
then
suddenly
tailing
off
into
silence
each
mumbling
out
his
own
thoughts
and
paying
little
heed
to
the
words
of
his
neighbour
the
farther
end
was
a
small
brazier
of
burning
charcoal
beside
which
on
a
three
legged
wooden
stool
there
sat
a
tall
thin
old
man
with
his
jaw
resting
upon
his
two
fists
and
his
elbows
upon
his
knees
staring
into
the
fire
i
entered
a
sallow
attendant
had
hurried
up
with
a
pipe
for
me
and
a
supply
of
the
drug
beckoning
me
to
an
empty
berth
you
i
have
not
come
to
stay
said
i
is
a
friend
of
mine
here
and
i
wish
to
speak
with
him
was
a
movement
and
an
exclamation
from
my
right
and
peering
through
the
gloom
i
saw
pale
haggard
and
unkempt
staring
out
at
me
s
said
he
was
in
a
pitiable
state
of
reaction
with
every
nerve
in
a
twitter
i
say
what
o
clock
is
it
eleven
what
day
th
heavens
i
thought
it
was
is
d
you
want
to
frighten
a
chap
for
sank
his
face
onto
his
arms
and
began
to
sob
in
a
high
treble
key
i
tell
you
that
it
is
man
wife
has
been
waiting
this
two
days
for
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
i
am
you
ve
got
mixed
for
i
have
only
been
here
a
few
hours
three
pipes
four
pipes
i
forget
how
many
i
ll
go
home
with
you
i
wouldn
t
frighten
poor
little
me
your
hand
you
a
cab
i
have
one
waiting
i
shall
go
in
it
i
must
owe
something
what
i
owe
i
am
all
off
colour
i
can
do
nothing
for
myself
i
walked
down
the
narrow
passage
between
the
double
row
of
sleepers
holding
my
breath
to
keep
out
the
vile
stupefying
fumes
of
the
drug
and
looking
about
for
the
manager
i
passed
the
tall
man
who
sat
by
the
brazier
i
felt
a
sudden
pluck
at
my
skirt
and
a
low
voice
whispered
past
me
and
then
look
back
at
me
words
fell
quite
distinctly
upon
my
ear
i
glanced
down
could
only
have
come
from
the
old
man
at
my
side
and
yet
he
sat
now
as
absorbed
as
ever
very
thin
very
wrinkled
bent
with
age
an
opium
pipe
dangling
down
from
between
his
knees
as
though
it
had
dropped
in
sheer
lassitude
from
his
fingers
i
took
two
steps
forward
and
looked
back
took
all
my
self
control
to
prevent
me
from
breaking
out
into
a
cry
of
astonishment
had
turned
his
back
so
that
none
could
see
him
but
i
form
had
filled
out
his
wrinkles
were
gone
the
dull
eyes
had
regained
their
fire
and
there
sitting
by
the
fire
and
grinning
at
my
surprise
was
none
other
than
made
a
slight
motion
to
me
to
approach
him
and
instantly
as
he
turned
his
face
half
round
to
the
company
once
more
subsided
into
a
doddering
loose
lipped
senility
i
whispered
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
in
this
den
low
as
you
can
he
answered
i
have
excellent
ears
you
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
get
rid
of
that
sottish
friend
of
yours
i
should
be
exceedingly
glad
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
i
have
a
cab
outside
pray
send
him
home
in
it
may
safely
trust
him
for
he
appears
to
be
too
limp
to
get
into
any
mischief
i
should
recommend
you
also
to
send
a
note
by
the
cabman
to
your
wife
to
say
that
you
have
thrown
in
your
lot
with
me
you
will
wait
outside
i
shall
be
with
you
in
five
minutes
was
difficult
to
refuse
any
of
requests
for
they
were
always
so
exceedingly
definite
and
put
forward
with
such
a
quiet
air
of
mastery
i
felt
however
that
when
was
once
confined
in
the
cab
my
mission
was
practically
accomplished
and
for
the
rest
i
could
not
wish
anything
better
than
to
be
associated
with
my
friend
in
one
of
those
singular
adventures
which
were
the
normal
condition
of
his
existence
a
few
minutes
i
had
written
my
note
paid
s
bill
led
him
out
to
the
cab
and
seen
him
driven
through
the
darkness
a
very
short
time
a
decrepit
figure
had
emerged
from
the
opium
den
and
i
was
walking
down
the
street
with
two
streets
he
shuffled
along
with
a
bent
back
and
an
uncertain
foot
glancing
quickly
round
he
straightened
himself
out
and
burst
into
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter
i
suppose
said
he
that
you
imagine
that
i
have
added
opium
smoking
to
cocaine
injections
and
all
the
other
little
weaknesses
on
which
you
have
favoured
me
with
your
medical
views
i
was
certainly
surprised
to
find
you
there
not
more
so
than
i
to
find
you
i
came
to
find
a
friend
i
to
find
an
enemy
enemy
one
of
my
natural
enemies
or
shall
i
say
my
natural
prey
i
am
in
the
midst
of
a
very
remarkable
inquiry
and
i
have
hoped
to
find
a
clue
in
the
incoherent
ramblings
of
these
sots
as
i
have
done
before
now
i
been
recognised
in
that
den
my
life
would
not
have
been
worth
an
hour
s
purchase
for
i
have
used
it
before
now
for
my
own
purposes
and
the
rascally
who
runs
it
has
sworn
to
have
vengeance
upon
me
is
a
trap
door
at
the
back
of
that
building
near
the
corner
of
s
which
could
tell
some
strange
tales
of
what
has
passed
through
it
upon
the
moonless
nights
do
not
mean
bodies
bodies

be
rich

we
had
pounds
for
every
poor
devil
who
has

done
to
death
in
that
den

the
vilest
murder
trap
on
the
whole
riverside
and
i
fear
that
has
entered
it
never
to
leave
it
more
our
trap
should
be
here
put
his
two
forefingers
between
his
teeth
and
whistled
shrilly
a
signal
which
was
answered
by
a
similar
whistle
from
the
distance
followed
shortly
by
the
rattle
of
wheels
and
the
clink
of
horses
hoofs
said
as
a
tall
dog
cart
dashed
up
through
the
gloom
throwing
out
two
golden
tunnels
of
yellow
light
from

side

about
eleven
her
her
head
long
then
flicked
the
horse
with
his
whip
and
we
dashed
away
through
the
endless
succession
of
sombre
and
deserted
streets
which
widened
gradually
until
we
were
flying
across
a
broad
balustraded
bridge
with
the
murky
river
flowing
sluggishly
beneath
us
lay
another
dull
wilderness
of
bricks
and
mortar
its
silence
broken
only
by
the
heavy
regular
footfall
of
the
policeman
or
the
songs
and
shouts
of
some
belated
party
of
revellers
a
dull
wrack
was
drifting
slowly
across
the
sky
and
a
star
or
two
twinkled
dimly
here
and
there
through
the
rifts
of
the
clouds
drove
in
silence
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
and
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
lost
in
thought
while
i
sat
beside
him
curious
to
learn
what
this
new
quest
might
be
which
seemed
to
tax
his
powers
so
sorely
and
yet
afraid
to
break
in
upon
the
current
of
his
thoughts
had
driven
several
miles
and
were
beginning
to
get
to
the
fringe
of
the
belt
of
suburban
villas
when
he
shook
himself
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
lit
up
his
pipe
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
satisfied
himself
that
he
is
acting
for
the
best
have
a
grand
gift
of
silence
said
he
makes
you
quite
invaluable
as
a
companion
my
word
it
is
a
great
thing
for
me
to
have
someone
to
talk
to
for
my
own
thoughts
are
not
over
pleasant
i
was
wondering
what
i
should
say
to
this
dear
little
woman
to
night
when
she
meets
me
at
the
door
forget
that
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
shall
just
have
time
to
tell
you
the
facts
of
the
case
before
we
get
to
seems
absurdly
simple
and
yet
somehow
i
can
get
nothing
to
go
upon
s
plenty
of
thread
no
doubt
but
i
can
t
get
the
end
of
it
into
my
hand
i
ll
state
the
case
clearly
and
concisely
to
you
and
maybe
you
can
see
a
spark
where
all
is
dark
to
me
then
years
ago
to
be
definite
in
there
came
to
a
gentleman
by
name
who
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
money
took
a
large
villa
laid
out
the
grounds
very
nicely
and
lived
generally
in
good
style
degrees
he
made
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
and
in
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
local
brewer
by
whom
he
now
has
two
children
had
no
occupation
but
was
interested
in
several
companies
and
went
into
town
as
a
rule
in
the
morning
returning
by
the
from
every
night
is
now
thirty
seven
years
of
age
is
a
man
of
temperate
habits
a
good
husband
a
very
affectionate
father
and
a
man
who
is
popular
with
all
who
know
him
i
may
add
that
his
whole
debts
at
the
present
moment
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain
amount
to
pounds
s
while
he
has
pounds
standing
to
his
credit
in
the
and
is
no
reason
therefore
to
think
that
money
troubles
have
been
weighing
upon
his
mind
went
into
town
rather
earlier
than
usual
remarking
before
he
started
that
he
had
two
important
commissions
to
perform
and
that
he
would
bring
his
little
boy
home
a
box
of
bricks
by
the
merest
chance
his
wife
received
a
telegram
upon
this
same
very
shortly
after
his
departure
to
the
effect
that
a
small
parcel
of
considerable
value
which
she
had
been
expecting
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
offices
of
the
if
you
are
well
up
in
your
you
will
know
that
the
office
of
the
company
is
in
which
branches
out
of
where
you
found
me
to
night
had
her
lunch
started
for
the
did
some
shopping
proceeded
to
the
company
s
office
got
her
packet
and
found
herself
at
exactly
walking
through
on
her
way
back
to
the
station
you
followed
me
so
far
is
very
clear
you
remember
was
an
exceedingly
hot
day
and
walked
slowly
glancing
about
in
the
hope
of
seeing
a
cab
as
she
did
not
like
the
neighbourhood
in
which
she
found
herself
she
was
walking
in
this
way
down
she
suddenly
heard
an
ejaculation
or
cry
and
was
struck
cold
to
see
her
husband
looking
down
at
her
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
beckoning
to
her
from
a
second
floor
window
window
was
open
and
she
distinctly
saw
his
face
which
she
describes
as
being
terribly
agitated
waved
his
hands
frantically
to
her
and
then
vanished
from
the
window
so
suddenly
that
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
had
been
plucked
back
by
some
irresistible
force
from
behind
singular
point
which
struck
her
quick
feminine
eye
was
that
although
he
wore
some
dark
coat
such
as
he
had
started
to
town
in
he
had
on
neither
collar
nor
necktie
that
something
was
amiss
with
him
she
rushed
down
the
steps
for
the
house
was
none
other
than
the
opium
den
in
which
you
found
me
to
night
and
running
through
the
front
room
she
attempted
to
ascend
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
first
floor
the
foot
of
the
stairs
however
she
met
this
scoundrel
of
whom
i
have
spoken
who
thrust
her
back
and
aided
by
a
who
acts
as
assistant
there
pushed
her
out
into
the
street
with
the
most
maddening
doubts
and
fears
she
rushed
down
the
lane
and
by
rare
good
fortune
met
in
a
number
of
constables
with
an
inspector
all
on
their
way
to
their
beat
inspector
and
two
men
accompanied
her
back
and
in
spite
of
the
continued
resistance
of
the
proprietor
they
made
their
way
to
the
room
in
which
had
last
been
seen
was
no
sign
of
him
there
fact
in
the
whole
of
that
floor
there
was
no
one
to
be
found
save
a
crippled
wretch
of
hideous
aspect
who
it
seems
made
his
home
there
he
and
the
stoutly
swore
that
no
one
else
had
been
in
the
front
room
during
the
afternoon
determined
was
their
denial
that
the
inspector
was
staggered
and
had
almost
come
to
believe
that
had
been
deluded
when
with
a
cry
she
sprang
at
a
small
deal
box
which
lay
upon
the
table
and
tore
the
lid
from
it

fell

cascade
of
children

bricks

the
toy
which
he
had
promised
to
bring
home
discovery
and
the
evident
confusion
which
the
cripple
showed
made
the
inspector
realise
that
the
matter
was
serious

were
carefully
examined
and

pointed
to

plainly
furnished
as
a

traces
of

were
to
be
seen
upon
the

several
scattered

were
visible
upon
the
wooden
floor
of
the
bedroom

behind
a
curtain

of

his
watch

no
signs
of

of
these

there
were
no

of
the
window

must
apparently
have
gone
for
no
other
exit
could
be
discovered
and
the
ominous
bloodstains
upon
the
sill
gave
little

could

himself

tragedy

to
be
immediately
implicated

the
matter

known
to
be
a
man
of
the
vilest
antecedents

as
by
s
story
he
was
known
to
have
been
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
within
a
very
few
seconds
of
her
husband
s
appearance
at
the
window

could
hardly
have
been
more
than
an
accessory
to
the
crime
defence
was
one
of
absolute
ignorance
and
he
protested
that
he
had
no
knowledge
as
to
the
doings
of
his
lodger
and
that
he
could
not
account
in
any
way
for
the
presence
of
the
missing
gentleman

for
the
manager
for
the
sinister
cripple
who
lives
upon
the
second
floor
of
the

the
last

you
may

small
angle
in

that

so
remarkable
that
no
one
can
pass
him
without
observing
him
a
shock
of
orange
hair
a
pale
face
disfigured
by
a
horrible
scar

by
its
contraction
has
turned
up
the
outer
edge
of
his
upper
lip

bulldog

pair
of

penetrating

present

colour
of

mark
him
out
from
amid
the
common
crowd

at
the

of

upon

she
was
escorted
home
in
a
cab

in
not
arresting
instantly
as
he
was
allowed
some

minutes
during
which
he
might

communicated
with
his

remedied

he
pointed
to
his
ring

which
had
been
cut
near
the
nail
and
explained
that
the
bleeding
came
from
there

that
he

to

long
before

that

from

clue

found
upon

what
they

what

a
fierce
eddy
between

likely
enough
that
the
weighted
coat
had
remained
when
the
stripped
body
had
been
sucked
away
into
the
river

that
all
the

were

in
the

the

dressed
in
a
coat
alone
sir
but
the
facts
might
be
met
speciously
enough
that
this
man
had
thrust
through
the
window
there
is
no
human
eye
which
could
have
seen
the
deed
would
he
do
then
would
of
course
instantly
strike
him
that
he
must
get
rid
of
the
tell
tale
garments
would
seize
the
coat
then
and
be
in
the
act
of
throwing
it
out
when
it
would
occur
to
him
that
it
would
swim
and
not
sink
has
little
time
for
he
has
heard
the
scuffle
downstairs
when
the
wife
tried
to
force
her
way
up
and
perhaps
he
has
already
heard
from
his
confederate
that
the
police
are
hurrying
up
the
street
is
not
an
instant
to
be
lost
rushes
to
some
secret
hoard
where
he
has
accumulated
the
fruits
of
his
beggary
and
he
stuffs
all
the
coins
upon
which
he
can
lay
his
hands
into
the
pockets
to
make
sure
of
the

sinking
throws
it
out

would
have
done
the
same
with
the
other
garments
had
not
he
heard
the
rush
of
steps
below
and
only
just
had
time
to
close
the
window
when
the
police
appeared
certainly
sounds
feasible
we
will
take
it
as
a
working
hypothesis
for

of
a
better

told
you

arrested

taken
to
the
station

it
could
not
be
shown
that
there
had
ever
before
been
anything
against
him
had
for
years
been
known
as
a
professional
beggar
but
his
life
appeared
to
have
been
a
very
quiet
and
innocent
one
the
matter
stands
at
present
and
the
questions
which
have
to
be
solved
what
was
doing
in
the
opium
den
what
happened
to
him
when
there
where
is
he
now
and
what
had
to
do
with
his
disappearance
are
all
as
far
from
a
solution
as
ever
i
confess
that
i
cannot
recall
any
case
within
my
experience
which
looked
at
the
first
glance
so
simple
and
yet
which
presented
such
difficulties
had
been
detailing
this
singular
series
of
events
we
had
been
whirling
through
the
outskirts
of
the
great
town
until
the
last
straggling
houses
had
been
left
behind
and
we
rattled
along
with
a
country
hedge
upon
either
side
of
us
as
he
finished
however
we
drove
through
two
scattered
villages
where
a
few
lights
still
glimmered
in
the
windows
are
on
the
outskirts
of
said
my
companion
have
touched
on
three
counties
in
our
short
drive
starting
in
passing
over
an
angle
of
and
ending
in
that
light
among
the
trees
is
and
beside
that
lamp
sits
a
woman
whose
anxious
ears
have
already
i
have
little
doubt
caught
the
clink
of
our
horse
s
feet
why
are
you
not
conducting
the
case
from
i
asked
there
are
many
inquiries
which
must
be
made
out
here
has
most
kindly
put
two
rooms
at
my
disposal
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
she
will
have
nothing
but
a
welcome
for
my
friend
and
colleague
i
hate
to
meet
her
when
i
have
no
news
of
her
husband
we
are
there
whoa
had
pulled
up
in
front
of
a
large
villa
which
stood
within
its
own
grounds
a
stable
boy
had
run
out
to
the
horse
s
head
and
springing
down
i
followed
up
the
small
winding
gravel
drive
which
led
to
the
house
we
approached
the
door
flew
open
and
a
little
blonde
woman
stood
in
the
opening
clad
in
some
sort
of
light
mousseline
de
soie
with
a
touch
of
fluffy
pink
chiffon
at
her
neck
and
wrists
stood
with
her
figure
outlined
against
the
flood
of
light
one
hand
upon
the
door
one
half
raised
in
her
eagerness
her
body
slightly
bent
her
head
and
face
protruded
with
eager
eyes
and
parted
lips
a
standing
question
she
cried
well
then
seeing
that
there
were
two
of
us
she
gave
a
cry
of
hope
which
sank
into
a
groan
as
she
saw
that
my
companion
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
good
news
bad
for
that
come
in
must
be
weary
for
you
have
had
a
long
day
is
my
friend
has
been
of
most
vital
use
to
me
in
several
of
my
cases
and
a
lucky
chance
has
made
it
possible
for
me
to
bring
him
out
and
associate
him
with
this
investigation
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
said
she
pressing
my
hand
warmly
will
i
am
sure
forgive
anything
that
may
be
wanting
in
our
arrangements
when
you
consider
the
blow
which
has
come
so
suddenly
upon
us
dear
madam
said
i
i
am
an
old
campaigner
and
if
i
were
not
i
can
very
well
see
that
no
apology
is
needed
i
can
be
of
any
assistance
either
to
you
or
to
my
friend
here
i
shall
be
indeed
happy
said
the
lady
as
we
entered
a
well
lit
dining
room
upon
the
table
of
which
a
cold
supper
had
been
laid
out
i
should
very
much
like
to
ask
you
one
or
two
plain
questions
to
which
i
beg
that
you
will
give
a
plain
answer
madam
not
trouble
about
my
feelings
i
am
not
hysterical
nor
given
to
fainting
i
simply
wish
to
hear
your
real
real
opinion
what
point
your
heart
of
hearts
do
you
think
that
is
alive
seemed
to
be
embarrassed
by
the
question
now
she
repeated
standing
upon
the
rug
and
looking
keenly
down
at
him
as
he
leaned
back
in
a
basket
chair
then
madam
i
do
not
think
that
he
is
dead
i
do
i
don
t
say
that
on
what
day
did
he
meet
his
death
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
explain
how
it
is
that
i
have
received
a
letter
from
him
to
day
sprang
out
of
his
chair
as
if
he
had
been
galvanised
he
roared
to
day
stood
smiling
holding
up
a
little
slip
of
paper
in
the
air
i
see
it
snatched
it
from
her
in
his
eagerness
and
smoothing
it
out
upon
the
table
he
drew
over
the
lamp
and
examined
it
intently
i
had
left
my
chair
and
was
gazing
at
it
over
his
shoulder
envelope
was
a
very
coarse
one
and
was
stamped
with
the
postmark
and
with
the
date
of
that
very
day
or
rather
of
the
day
before
for
it
was
considerably
after
midnight
writing
murmured
this
is
not
your
husband
s
writing
madam
but
the
enclosure
is
i
perceive
also
that
whoever
addressed
the
envelope
had
to
go
and
inquire
as
to
the
address
can
you
tell
that
name
you
see
is
in
perfectly
black
ink
which
has
dried
itself
rest
is
of
the
greyish
colour
which
shows
that
blotting
paper
has
been
used
it
had
been
written
straight
off
and
then
blotted
none
would
be
of
a
deep
black
shade
man
has
written
the
name
and
there
has
then
been
a
pause
before
he
wrote
the
address
which
can
only
mean
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
it
is
of
course
a
trifle
but
there
is
nothing
so
important
as
trifles
us
now
see
the
letter
there
has
been
an
enclosure
here
there
was
a
ring
signet
ring
you
are
sure
that
this
is
your
husband
s
hand
of
his
hands
hand
when
he
wrote
hurriedly
is
very
unlike
his
usual
writing
and
yet
i
know
it
well
do
not
be
frightened
will
come
well
is
a
huge
error
which
it
may
take
some
little
time
to
rectify
in
patience
neville
in
pencil
upon
the
fly
leaf
of
a
book
octavo
size
no
water
mark
to
day
in
by
a
man
with
a
dirty
thumb
the
flap
has
been
gummed
if
i
am
not
very
much
in
error
by
a
person
who
had
been
chewing
tobacco
you
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
your
husband
s
hand
madam
wrote
those
words
they
were
posted
to
day
at
the
clouds
lighten
though
i
should
not
venture
to
say
that
the
danger
is
over
he
must
be
alive
this
is
a
clever
forgery
to
put
us
on
the
wrong
scent
ring
after
all
proves
nothing
may
have
been
taken
from
him
no
it
is
it
is
his
very
own
writing
well
may
however
have
been
written
on
and
only
posted
to
day
is
possible
so
much
may
have
happened
between
you
must
not
discourage
me
i
know
that
all
is
well
with
him
is
so
keen
a
sympathy
between
us
that
i
should
know
if
evil
came
upon
him
the
very
day
that
i
saw
him
last
he
cut
himself
in
the
bedroom
and
yet
i
in
the
dining
room
rushed
upstairs
instantly
with
the
utmost
certainty
that
something
had
happened
you
think
that
i
would
respond
to
such
a
trifle
and
yet
be
ignorant
of
his
death
i
have
seen
too
much
not
to
know
that
the
impression
of
a
woman
may
be
more
valuable
than
the
conclusion
of
an
analytical
reasoner
in
this
letter
you
certainly
have
a
very
strong
piece
of
evidence
to
corroborate
your
view
if
your
husband
is
alive
and
able
to
write
letters
why
should
he
remain
away
from
you
i
cannot
imagine
is
unthinkable
on
he
made
no
remarks
before
leaving
you
you
were
surprised
to
see
him
in
much
so
the
window
open
he
might
have
called
to
you
might
only
as
i
understand
gave
an
inarticulate
cry
a
call
for
help
you
thought
waved
his
hands
it
might
have
been
a
cry
of
surprise
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
you
might
cause
him
to
throw
up
his
hands
is
possible
you
thought
he
was
pulled
back
disappeared
so
suddenly
might
have
leaped
back
did
not
see
anyone
else
in
the
room
but
this
horrible
man
confessed
to
having
been
there
and
the
was
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
so
husband
as
far
as
you
could
see
had
his
ordinary
clothes
on
without
his
collar
or
tie
i
distinctly
saw
his
bare
throat
he
ever
spoken
of
he
ever
showed
any
signs
of
having
taken
opium
you
are
the
principal
points
about
which
i
wished
to
be
absolutely
clear
shall
now
have
a
little
supper
and
then
retire
for
we
may
have
a
very
busy
day
to
morrow
a
large
and
comfortable
double
bedded
room
had
been
placed
at
our
disposal
and
i
was
quickly
between
the
sheets
for
i
was
weary
after
my
night
of
adventure
was
a
man
however
who
when
he
had
an
unsolved
problem
upon
his
mind
would
go
for
days
and
even
for
a
week
without
rest
turning
it
over
rearranging
his
facts
looking
at
it
from
every
point
of
view
until
he
had
either
fathomed
it
or
convinced
himself
that
his
data
were
insufficient
was
soon
evident
to
me
that
he
was
now
preparing
for
an
all
night
sitting
took
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat
put
on
a
large
blue
dressing
gown
and
then
wandered
about
the
room
collecting
pillows
from
his
bed
and
cushions
from
the
sofa
and
armchairs
these
he
constructed
a
sort
of
divan
upon
which
he
perched
himself
cross
legged
with
an
ounce
of
shag
tobacco
and
a
box
of
matches
laid
out
in
front
of
him
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
i
saw
him
sitting
there
an
old
briar
pipe
between
his
lips
his
eyes
fixed
vacantly
upon
the
corner
of
the
ceiling
the
blue
smoke
curling
up
from
him
silent
motionless
with
the
light
shining
upon
his
strong
set
aquiline
features
he
sat
as
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
and
so
he
sat
when
a
sudden
ejaculation
caused
me
to
wake
up
and
i
found
the
summer
sun
shining
into
the
apartment
pipe
was
still
between
his
lips
the
smoke
still
curled
upward
and
the
room
was
full
of
a
dense
tobacco
haze
but
nothing
remained
of
the
heap
of
shag
which
i
had
seen
upon
the
previous
night
he
asked
for
a
morning
drive
dress
one
is
stirring
yet
but
i
know
where
the
stable
boy
sleeps
and
we
shall
soon
have
the
trap
out
chuckled
to
himself
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
twinkled
and
he
seemed
a
different
man
to
the
sombre
thinker
of
the
previous
night
i
dressed
i
glanced
at
my
watch
was
no
wonder
that
no
one
was
stirring
was
twenty
five
minutes
past
four
i
had
hardly
finished
when
returned
with
the
news
that
the
boy
was
putting
in
the
horse
i
want
to
test
a
little
theory
of
mine
said
he
pulling
on
his
boots
i
think
that
you
are
now
standing
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
most
absolute
fools
in
i
deserve
to
be
kicked
from
here
to
i
think
i
have
the
key
of
the
affair
now
where
is
it
i
asked
smiling
the
bathroom
he
answered
yes
i
am
not
joking
he
continued
seeing
my
look
of
incredulity
i
have
just
been
there
and
i
have
taken
it
out
and
i
have
got
it
in
this
bag
on
my
boy
and
we
shall
see
whether
it
will
not
fit
the
lock
made
our
way
downstairs
as
quietly
as
possible
and
out
into
the
bright
morning
sunshine
the
road
stood
our
horse
and
trap
with
the
half
clad
stable
boy
waiting
at
the
head
both
sprang
in
and
away
we
dashed
down
the
a
few
country
carts
were
stirring
bearing
in
vegetables
to
the
metropolis
but
the
lines
of
villas
on
either
side
were
as
silent
and
lifeless
as
some
city
in
a
dream
has
been
in
some
points
a
singular
case
said
flicking
the
horse
on
into
a
gallop
i
confess
that
i
have
been
as
blind
as
a
mole
but
it
is
better
to
learn
wisdom
late
than
never
to
learn
it
at
all
town
the
earliest
risers
were
just
beginning
to
look
sleepily
from
their
windows
as
we
drove
through
the
streets
of
the
side
down
the
we
crossed
over
the
river
and
dashing
up
wheeled
sharply
to
the
right
and
found
ourselves
in
was
well
known
to
the
force
and
the
two
constables
at
the
door
saluted
him
of
them
held
the
horse
s
head
while
the
other
led
us
in
is
on
duty
asked
sir
how
are
you
a
tall
stout
official
had
come
down
the
stone
flagged
passage
in
a
peaked
cap
and
frogged
jacket
i
wish
to
have
a
quiet
word
with
you
into
my
room
here
was
a
small
office
like
room
with
a
huge
ledger
upon
the
table
and
a
telephone
projecting
from
the
wall
inspector
sat
down
at
his
desk
can
i
do
for
you
i
called
about
that
beggarman
the
one
who
was
charged
with
being
concerned
in
the
disappearance
of
of
was
brought
up
and
remanded
for
further
inquiries
i
heard
have
him
here
the
cells
he
quiet
he
gives
no
trouble
he
is
a
dirty
scoundrel
it
is
all
we
can
do
to
make
him
wash
his
hands
and
his
face
is
as
black
as
a
tinker
s
when
once
his
case
has
been
settled
he
will
have
a
regular
prison
bath
and
i
think
if
you
saw
him
you
would
agree
with
me
that
he
needed
it
i
should
like
to
see
him
very
much
you
is
easily
done
this
way
can
leave
your
bag
i
think
that
i
ll
take
it
good
this
way
if
you
please
led
us
down
a
passage
opened
a
barred
door
passed
down
a
winding
stair
and
brought
us
to
a
whitewashed
corridor
with
a
line
of
doors
on
each
side
third
on
the
right
is
his
said
the
inspector
it
is
quietly
shot
back
a
panel
in
the
upper
part
of
the
door
and
glanced
through
is
asleep
said
he
can
see
him
very
well
both
put
our
eyes
to
the
grating
prisoner
lay
with
his
face
towards
us
in
a
very
deep
sleep
breathing
slowly
and
heavily
was
a
middle
sized
man
coarsely
clad
as
became
his
calling
with
a
coloured
shirt
protruding
through
the
rent
in
his
tattered
coat
was
as
the
inspector
had
said
extremely
dirty
but
the
grime
which
covered
his
face
could
not
conceal
its
repulsive
ugliness
a
broad
wheal
from
an
old
scar
ran
right
across
it
from
eye
to
chin
and
by
its
contraction
had
turned
up
one
side
of
the
upper
lip
so
that
three
teeth
were
exposed
in
a
perpetual
snarl
a
shock
of
very
bright
red
hair
grew
low
over
his
eyes
and
forehead
s
a
beauty
isn
t
he
said
the
inspector
certainly
needs
a
wash
remarked
i
had
an
idea
that
he
might
and
i
took
the
liberty
of
bringing
the
tools
with
me
opened
the
bag
as
he
spoke
and
took
out
to
my
astonishment
a
very
large
bath
sponge
he
are
a
funny
one
chuckled
the
inspector
if
you
will
have
the
great
goodness
to
open
that
door
very
quietly
we
will
soon
make
him
cut
a
much
more
respectable
figure
i
don
t
know
why
not
said
the
inspector
doesn
t
look
a
credit
to
the
cells
does
he
slipped
his
key
into
the
lock
and
we
all
very
quietly
entered
the
cell
sleeper
half
turned
and
then
settled
down
once
more
into
a
deep
slumber
stooped
to
the
water
jug
moistened
his
sponge
and
then
rubbed
it
twice
vigorously
across
and
down
the
prisoner
s
face
me
introduce
you
he
shouted
to
of
in
the
county
of
in
my
life
have
i
seen
such
a
sight
man
s
face
peeled
off
under
the
sponge
like
the
bark
from
a
tree
was
the
coarse
brown
tint
too
was
the
horrid
scar
which
had
seamed
it
across
and
the
twisted
lip
which
had
given
the
repulsive
sneer
to
the
face
a
twitch
brought
away
the
tangled
red
hair
and
there
sitting
up
in
his
bed
was
a
pale
sad
faced
refined
looking
man
black
haired
and
smooth
skinned
rubbing
his
eyes
and
staring
about
him
with
sleepy
bewilderment
suddenly
realising
the
exposure
he
broke
into
a
scream
and
threw
himself
down
with
his
face
to
the
pillow
heavens
cried
the
inspector
it
is
indeed
the
missing
man
i
know
him
from
the
photograph
prisoner
turned
with
the
reckless
air
of
a
man
who
abandons
himself
to
his
destiny
it
so
said
he
pray
what
am
i
charged
with
making
away
with
come
you
can
t
be
charged
with
that
unless
they
make
a
case
of
attempted
suicide
of
it
said
the
inspector
with
a
grin
i
have
been
twenty
seven
years
in
the
force
but
this
really
takes
the
cake
i
am
then
it
is
obvious
that
no
crime
has
been
committed
and
that
therefore
i
am
illegally
detained
crime
but
a
very
great
error
has
been
committed
said
would
have
done
better
to
have
trusted
your
wife
was
not
the
wife
it
was
the
children
groaned
the
prisoner
help
me
i
would
not
have
them
ashamed
of
their
father
an
exposure
can
i
do
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
couch
and
patted
him
kindly
on
the
shoulder
you
leave
it
to
a
court
of
law
to
clear
the
matter
up
said
he
of
course
you
can
hardly
avoid
publicity
the
other
hand
if
you
convince
the
police
authorities
that
there
is
no
possible
case
against
you
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
any
reason
that
the
details
should
find
their
way
into
the
papers
would
i
am
sure
make
notes
upon
anything
which
you
might
tell
us
and
submit
it
to
the
proper
authorities
case
would
then
never
go
into
court
at
all
bless
you
cried
the
prisoner
passionately
i
would
have
endured
imprisonment
ay
even
execution
rather
than
have
left
my
miserable
secret
as
a
family
blot
to
my
children
are
the
first
who
have
ever
heard
my
story
father
was
a
schoolmaster
in
where
i
received
an
excellent
education
i
travelled
in
my
youth
took
to
the
stage
and
finally
became
a
reporter
on
an
evening
paper
in
day
my
editor
wished
to
have
a
series
of
articles
upon
begging
in
the
metropolis
and
i
volunteered
to
supply
them
was
the
point
from
which
all
my
adventures
started
was
only
by
trying
begging
as
an
amateur
that
i
could
get
the
facts
upon
which
to
base
my
articles
an
actor
i
had
of
course
learned
all
the
secrets
of
making
up
and
had
been
famous
in
the
green
room
for
my
skill
i
took
advantage
now
of
my
attainments
i
painted
my
face
and
to
make
myself
as
pitiable
as
possible
i
made
a
good
scar
and
fixed
one
side
of
my
lip
in
a
twist
by
the
aid
of
a
small
slip
of
flesh
coloured
plaster
with
a
red
head
of
hair
and
an
appropriate
dress
i
took
my
station
in
the
business
part
of
the
city
ostensibly
as
a
match
seller
but
really
as
a
beggar
seven
hours
i
plied
my
trade
and
when
i
returned
home
in
the
evening
i
found
to
my
surprise
that
i
had
received
no
less
than
s
d
i
wrote
my
articles
and
thought
little
more
of
the
matter
until
some
time
later
i
backed
a
bill
for
a
friend
and
had
a
writ
served
upon
me
for
pounds
i
was
at
my
wit
s
end
where
to
get
the
money
but
a
sudden
idea
came
to
me
i
begged
a
fortnight
s
grace
from
the
creditor
asked
for
a
holiday
from
my
employers
and
spent
the
time
in
begging
in
the
under
my
disguise
ten
days
i
had
the
money
and
had
paid
the
debt
you
can
imagine
how
hard
it
was
to
settle
down
to
arduous
work
at
pounds
a
week
when
i
knew
that
i
could
earn
as
much
in
a
day
by
smearing
my
face
with
a
little
paint
laying
my
cap
on
the
ground
and
sitting
still
was
a
long
fight
between
my
pride
and
the
money
but
the
dollars
won
at
last
and
i
threw
up
reporting
and
sat
day
after
day
in
the
corner
which
i
had
first
chosen
inspiring
pity
by
my
ghastly
face
and
filling
my
pockets
with
coppers
one
man
knew
my
secret
was
the
keeper
of
a
low
den
in
which
i
used
to
lodge
in
where
i
could
every
morning
emerge
as
a
squalid
beggar
and
in
the
evenings
transform
myself
into
a
well
dressed
man
about
town
fellow
a
was
well
paid
by
me
for
his
rooms
so
that
i
knew
that
my
secret
was
safe
in
his
possession
very
soon
i
found
that
i
was
saving
considerable
sums
of
money
i
do
not
mean
that
any
beggar
in
the
streets
of
could
earn
pounds
a
year
which
is
less
than
my
average
takings
but
i
had
exceptional
advantages
in
my
power
of
making
up
and
also
in
a
facility
of
repartee
which
improved
by
practice
and
made
me
quite
a
recognised
character
in
the
day
a
stream
of
pennies
varied
by
silver
poured
in
upon
me
and
it
was
a
very
bad
day
in
which
i
failed
to
take
pounds
i
grew
richer
i
grew
more
ambitious
took
a
house
in
the
country
and
eventually
married
without
anyone
having
a
suspicion
as
to
my
real
occupation
dear
wife
knew
that
i
had
business
in
the
little
knew
what
i
had
finished
for
the
day
and
was
dressing
in
my
room
above
the
opium
den
when
i
looked
out
of
my
window
and
saw
to
my
horror
and
astonishment
that
my
wife
was
standing
in
the
street
with
her
eyes
fixed
full
upon
me
i
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
threw
up
my
arms
to
cover
my
face
and
rushing
to
my
confidant
the
entreated
him
to
prevent
anyone
from
coming
up
to
me
i
heard
her
voice
downstairs
but
i
knew
that
she
could
not
ascend
i
threw
off
my
clothes
pulled
on
those
of
a
beggar
and
put
on
my
pigments
and
wig
a
wife
s
eyes
could
not
pierce
so
complete
a
disguise
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
might
be
a
search
in
the
room
and
that
the
clothes
might
betray
me
i
threw
open
the
window
reopening
by
my
violence
a
small
cut
which
i
had
inflicted
upon
myself
in
the
bedroom
that
morning
i
seized
my
coat
which
was
weighted
by
the
coppers
which
i
had
just
transferred
to
it
from
the
leather
bag
in
which
i
carried
my
takings
i
hurled
it
out
of
the
window
and
it
disappeared
into
the
other
clothes
would
have
followed
but
at
that
moment
there
was
a
rush
of
constables
up
the
stair
and
a
few
minutes
after
i
found
rather
i
confess
to
my
relief
that
instead
of
being
identified
as
i
was
arrested
as
his
murderer
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
anything
else
for
me
to
explain
i
was
determined
to
preserve
my
disguise
as
long
as
possible
and
hence
my
preference
for
a
dirty
face
that
my
wife
would
be
terribly
anxious
i
slipped
off
my
ring
and
confided
it
to
the
at
a
moment
when
no
constable
was
watching
me
together
with
a
hurried
scrawl
telling
her
that
she
had
no
cause
to
fear
note
only
reached
her
yesterday
said
a
week
she
must
have
spent
police
have
watched
this
said
and
i
can
quite
understand
that
he
might
find
it
difficult
to
post
a
letter
unobserved
he
handed
it
to
some
sailor
customer
of
his
who
forgot
all
about
it
for
some
days
was
it
said
nodding
approvingly
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
have
you
never
been
prosecuted
for
begging
times
but
what
was
a
fine
to
me
must
stop
here
however
said
the
police
are
to
hush
this
thing
up
there
must
be
no
more
of
i
have
sworn
it
by
the
most
solemn
oaths
which
a
man
can
take
that
case
i
think
that
it
is
probable
that
no
further
steps
may
be
taken
if
you
are
found
again
then
all
must
come
out
i
am
sure
that
we
are
very
much
indebted
to
you
for
having
cleared
the
matter
up
i
wish
i
knew
how
you
reach
your
results
i
reached
this
one
said
my
friend
by
sitting
upon
five
pillows
and
consuming
an
ounce
of
shag
i
think
that
if
we
drive
to
we
shall
just
be
in
time
for
breakfast
vii
the
adventure
of
the
blue
carbuncle
i
had
called
upon
my
friend
upon
the
second
morning
after
with
the
intention
of
wishing
him
the
compliments
of
the
season
was
lounging
upon
the
sofa
in
a
purple
dressing
gown
a
pipe
rack
within
his
reach
upon
the
right
and
a
pile
of
crumpled
morning
papers
evidently
newly
studied
near
at
hand
the
couch
was
a
wooden
chair
and
on
the
angle
of
the
back
hung
a
very
seedy
and
disreputable
hard
felt
hat
much
the
worse
for
wear
and
cracked
in
several
places
a
lens
and
a
forceps
lying
upon
the
seat
of
the
chair
suggested
that
the
hat
had
been
suspended
in
this
manner
for
the
purpose
of
examination
are
engaged
said
i
perhaps
i
interrupt
you
at
all
i
am
glad
to
have
a
friend
with
whom
i
can
discuss
my
results
matter
is
a
perfectly
trivial
one
he
jerked
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
old
hat
but
there
are
points
in
connection
with
it
which
are
not
entirely
devoid
of
interest
and
even
of
instruction
i
seated
myself
in
his
armchair
and
warmed
my
hands
before
his
crackling
fire
for
a
sharp
frost
had
set
in
and
the
windows
were
thick
with
the
ice
crystals
i
suppose
i
remarked
that
homely
as
it
looks
this
thing
has
some
deadly
story
linked
on
to
it
that
it
is
the
clue
which
will
guide
you
in
the
solution
of
some
mystery
and
the
punishment
of
some
crime
no
crime
said
laughing
one
of
those
whimsical
little
incidents
which
will
happen
when
you
have
four
million
human
beings
all
jostling
each
other
within
the
space
of
a
few
square
miles
the
action
and
reaction
of
so
dense
a
swarm
of
humanity
every
possible
combination
of
events
may
be
expected
to
take
place
and
many
a
little
problem
will
be
presented
which
may
be
striking
and
bizarre
without
being
criminal
have
already
had
experience
of
such
much
so
i
remarked
that
of
the
last
six
cases
which
i
have
added
to
my
notes
three
have
been
entirely
free
of
any
legal
crime
allude
to
my
attempt
to
recover
the
papers
to
the
singular
case
of
and
to
the
adventure
of
the
man
with
the
twisted
lip
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
small
matter
will
fall
into
the
same
innocent
category
know
the
commissionaire
is
to
him
that
this
trophy
belongs
is
his
hat
no
he
found
it
owner
is
unknown
i
beg
that
you
will
look
upon
it
not
as
a
battered
billycock
but
as
an
intellectual
problem
first
as
to
how
it
came
here
arrived
upon
morning
in
company
with
a
good
fat
goose
which
is
i
have
no
doubt
roasting
at
this
moment
in
front
of
s
fire
facts
are
these
about
four
o
clock
on
morning
who
as
you
know
is
a
very
honest
fellow
was
returning
from
some
small
jollification
and
was
making
his
way
homeward
down
front
of
him
he
saw
in
the
gaslight
a
tallish
man
walking
with
a
slight
stagger
and
carrying
a
white
goose
slung
over
his
shoulder
he
reached
the
corner
of
a
row
broke
out
between
this
stranger
and
a
little
knot
of
roughs
of
the
latter
knocked
off
the
man
s
hat
on
which
he
raised
his
stick
to
defend
himself
and
swinging
it
over
his
head
smashed
the
shop
window
behind
him
had
rushed
forward
to
protect
the
stranger
from
his
assailants
but
the
man
shocked
at
having
broken
the
window
and
seeing
an
official
looking
person
in
uniform
rushing
towards
him
dropped
his
goose
took
to
his
heels
and
vanished
amid
the
labyrinth
of
small
streets
which
lie
at
the
back
of
roughs
had
also
fled
at
the
appearance
of
so
that
he
was
left
in
possession
of
the
field
of
battle
and
also
of
the
spoils
of
victory
in
the
shape
of
this
battered
hat
and
a
most
unimpeachable
goose
surely
he
restored
to
their
owner
dear
fellow
there
lies
the
problem
is
true
that
was
printed
upon
a
small
card
which
was
tied
to
the
bird
s
left
leg
and
it
is
also
true
that
the
initials
h
b
are
legible
upon
the
lining
of
this
hat
but
as
there
are
some
thousands
of
and
some
hundreds
of
in
this
city
of
ours
it
is
not
easy
to
restore
lost
property
to
any
one
of
them
then
did
do
brought
round
both
hat
and
goose
to
me
on
morning
knowing
that
even
the
smallest
problems
are
of
interest
to
me
goose
we
retained
until
this
morning
when
there
were
signs
that
in
spite
of
the
slight
frost
it
would
be
well
that
it
should
be
eaten
without
unnecessary
delay
finder
has
carried
it
off
therefore
to
fulfil
the
ultimate
destiny
of
a
goose
while
i
continue
to
retain
the
hat
of
the
unknown
gentleman
who
lost
his
dinner
he
not
advertise
what
clue
could
you
have
as
to
his
identity
as
much
as
we
can
deduce
his
hat
you
are
joking
can
you
gather
from
this
old
battered
felt
is
my
lens
know
my
methods
can
you
gather
yourself
as
to
the
individuality
of
the
man
who
has
worn
this
article
i
took
the
tattered
object
in
my
hands
and
turned
it
over
rather
ruefully
was
a
very
ordinary
black
hat
of
the
usual
round
shape
hard
and
much
the
worse
for
wear
lining
had
been
of
red
silk
but
was
a
good
deal
discoloured
was
no
maker
s
name
but
as
had
remarked
the
initials
h
b
were
scrawled
upon
one
side
was
pierced
in
the
brim
for
a
hat
securer
but
the
elastic
was
missing
the
rest
it
was
cracked
exceedingly
dusty
and
spotted
in
several
places
although
there
seemed
to
have
been
some
attempt
to
hide
the
discoloured
patches
by
smearing
them
with
ink
i
can
see
nothing
said
i
handing
it
back
to
my
friend
the
contrary
you
can
see
everything
fail
however
to
reason
from
what
you
see
are
too
timid
in
drawing
your
inferences
pray
tell
me
what
it
is
that
you
can
infer
from
this
hat
picked
it
up
and
gazed
at
it
in
the
peculiar
introspective
fashion
which
was
characteristic
of
him
is
perhaps
less
suggestive
than
it
might
have
been
he
remarked
and
yet
there
are
a
few
inferences
which
are
very
distinct
and
a
few
others
which
represent
at
least
a
strong
balance
of
probability
the
man
was
highly
intellectual
is
of
course
obvious
upon
the
face
of
it
and
also
that
he
was
fairly
well
to
do
within
the
last
three
years
although
he
has
now
fallen
upon
evil
days
had
foresight
but
has
less
now
than
formerly
pointing
to
a
moral
retrogression
which
when
taken
with
the
decline
of
his
fortunes
seems
to
indicate
some
evil
influence
probably
drink
at
work
upon
him
may
account
also
for
the
obvious
fact
that
his
wife
has
ceased
to
love
him
dear
has
however
retained
some
degree
of
self
respect
he
continued
disregarding
my
remonstrance
is
a
man
who
leads
a
sedentary
life
goes
out
little
is
out
of
training
entirely
is
middle
aged
has
grizzled
hair
which
he
has
had
cut
within
the
last
few
days
and
which
he
anoints
with
lime
cream
are
the
more
patent
facts
which
are
to
be
deduced
from
his
hat
by
the
way
that
it
is
extremely
improbable
that
he
has
gas
laid
on
in
his
house
are
certainly
joking
in
the
least
it
possible
that
even
now
when
i
give
you
these
results
you
are
unable
to
see
how
they
are
attained
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
am
very
stupid
but
i
must
confess
that
i
am
unable
to
follow
you
example
how
did
you
deduce
that
this
man
was
intellectual
answer
clapped
the
hat
upon
his
head
came
right
over
the
forehead
and
settled
upon
the
bridge
of
his
nose
is
a
question
of
cubic
capacity
said
he
a
man
with
so
large
a
brain
must
have
something
in
it
decline
of
his
fortunes
then
hat
is
three
years
old
flat
brims
curled
at
the
edge
came
in
then
is
a
hat
of
the
very
best
quality
at
the
band
of
ribbed
silk
and
the
excellent
lining
this
man
could
afford
to
buy
so
expensive
a
hat
three
years
ago
and
has
had
no
hat
since
then
he
has
assuredly
gone
down
in
the
world
that
is
clear
enough
certainly
how
about
the
foresight
and
the
moral
retrogression
laughed
is
the
foresight
said
he
putting
his
finger
upon
the
little
disc
and
loop
of
the
hat
securer
are
never
sold
upon
hats
this
man
ordered
one
it
is
a
sign
of
a
certain
amount
of
foresight
since
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
take
this
precaution
against
the
wind
since
we
see
that
he
has
broken
the
elastic
and
has
not
troubled
to
replace
it
it
is
obvious
that
he
has
less
foresight
now
than
formerly
which
is
a
distinct
proof
of
a
weakening
nature
the
other
hand
he
has
endeavoured
to
conceal
some
of
these
stains
upon
the
felt
by
daubing
them
with
ink
which
is
a
sign
that
he
has
not
entirely
lost
his
self
respect
reasoning
is
certainly
plausible
further
points
that
he
is
middle
aged
that
his
hair
is
grizzled
that
it
has
been
recently
cut
and
that
he
uses
lime
cream
are
all
to
be
gathered
from
a
close
examination
of
the
lower
part
of
the
lining
lens
discloses
a
large
number
of
hair
ends
clean
cut
by
the
scissors
of
the
barber
all
appear
to
be
adhesive
and
there
is
a
distinct
odour
of
lime
cream
dust
you
will
observe
is
not
the
gritty
grey
dust
of
the
street
but
the
fluffy
brown
dust
of
the
house
showing
that
it
has
been
hung
up
indoors
most
of
the
time
while
the
marks
of
moisture
upon
the
inside
are
proof
positive
that
the
wearer
perspired
very
freely
and
could
therefore
hardly
be
in
the
best
of
training
his
wife
you
said
that
she
had
ceased
to
love
him
hat
has
not
been
brushed
for
weeks
i
see
you
my
dear
with
a
week
s
accumulation
of
dust
upon
your
hat
and
when
your
wife
allows
you
to
go
out
in
such
a
state
i
shall
fear
that
you
also
have
been
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
your
wife
s
affection
he
might
be
a
bachelor
he
was
bringing
home
the
goose
as
a
peace
offering
to
his
wife
the
card
upon
the
bird
s
leg
have
an
answer
to
everything
how
on
earth
do
you
deduce
that
the
gas
is
not
laid
on
in
his
house
tallow
stain
or
even
two
might
come
by
chance
but
when
i
see
no
less
than
five
i
think
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
individual
must
be
brought
into
frequent
contact
with
burning
tallow
walks
upstairs
at
night
probably
with
his
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
guttering
candle
in
the
other
he
never
got
tallow
stains
from
a
gas
jet
you
satisfied
it
is
very
ingenious
said
i
laughing
but
since
as
you
said
just
now
there
has
been
no
crime
committed
and
no
harm
done
save
the
loss
of
a
goose
all
this
seems
to
be
rather
a
waste
of
energy
had
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
when
the
door
flew
open
and
the
commissionaire
rushed
into
the
apartment
with
flushed
cheeks
and
the
face
of
a
man
who
is
dazed
with
astonishment
goose
goose
sir
he
gasped
of
it
then
it
returned
to
life
and
flapped
off
through
the
kitchen
window
twisted
himself
round
upon
the
sofa
to
get
a
fairer
view
of
the
man
s
excited
face
here
sir
what
my
wife
found
in
its
crop
held
out
his
hand
and
displayed
upon
the
centre
of
the
palm
a
brilliantly
scintillating
blue
stone
rather
smaller
than
a
bean
in
size
but
of
such
purity
and
radiance
that
it
twinkled
like
an
electric
point
in
the
dark
hollow
of
his
hand
sat
up
with
a
whistle
said
he
this
is
treasure
trove
indeed
i
suppose
you
know
what
you
have
got
a
diamond
sir
a
precious
stone
cuts
into
glass
as
though
it
were
putty
s
more
than
a
precious
stone
is
the
precious
stone
the
of
s
blue
carbuncle
i
ejaculated
so
i
ought
to
know
its
size
and
shape
seeing
that
i
have
read
the
advertisement
about
it
in
every
day
lately
is
absolutely
unique
and
its
value
can
only
be
conjectured
but
the
reward
offered
of
pounds
is
certainly
not
within
a
twentieth
part
of
the
market
price
a
thousand
pounds
of
mercy
commissionaire
plumped
down
into
a
chair
and
stared
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
is
the
reward
and
i
have
reason
to
know
that
there
are
sentimental
considerations
in
the
background
which
would
induce
the
to
part
with
half
her
fortune
if
she
could
but
recover
the
gem
was
lost
if
i
remember
aright
at
the
i
remarked
so
on
nd
just
five
days
ago
a
plumber
was
accused
of
having
abstracted
it
from
the
lady
s
jewel
case
evidence
against
him
was
so
strong
that
the
case
has
been
referred
to
the
i
have
some
account
of
the
matter
here
i
believe
rummaged
amid
his
newspapers
glancing
over
the
dates
until
at
last
he
smoothed
one
out
doubled
it
over
and
read
the
following
paragraph
plumber

brought
up
upon
the
charge
of

the
of
the
valuable
gem

as

blue
carbuncle

attendant
at
the
hotel
gave
his
evidence
to
the
effect
that
he
had
shown
up
to
the
dressing
room
of
the
of
upon
the
day
of
the
robbery
in
order
that
he
might

the
grate
which
was
loose

remained
with
some
little
time
but
had
finally
been
called
away
returning
he
found
that
had
disappeared
that
the
bureau
had
been
forced
open
and
that
the
small
morocco
casket
in
which
as
it
afterwards
transpired

accustomed
to
keep

lying
empty
upon
the
dressing
table
instantly
gave
the
alarm
and
was
arrested
the
same
evening
but
the
stone
could
not
be
found
either
upon
his
person
or
in
his
rooms
maid
to
the
deposed
to
having
heard
s
cry
of
dismay
on
discovering
the
robbery
and
to
having
rushed
into
the
room
where
she
found
matters
as
described
by
the
last
witness
b
division
gave
evidence
as
to
the
arrest
of
who
struggled
frantically
and
protested
his
innocence
in
the
strongest
terms
of
a
previous
conviction
for
robbery
having
been
given
against
the
prisoner
the
magistrate
refused
to
deal
summarily
with
the
offence
but
referred
it
to
the
who
had
shown
signs
of
intense
emotion
during
the
proceedings
fainted
away
at
the
conclusion
and
was
carried
out
of
court
much
for
the
police
court
said
thoughtfully
tossing
aside
the
paper
question
for
us
now
to
solve
is
the
sequence
of
events
leading
from
a
rifled
jewel
case
at
one
end
to
the
crop
of
a
goose
in
at
the
other
see
our
little
deductions
have
suddenly
assumed
a
much
more
important
and
less
innocent
aspect
is
the
stone
the
stone
came
from
the
goose
and
the
goose
came
from
the
gentleman
with
the
bad
hat
and
all
the
other
characteristics
with
which
i
have
bored
you
now
we
must
set
ourselves
very
seriously
to
finding
this
gentleman
and
ascertaining
what
part
he
has
played
in
this
little
mystery
do
this
we
must
try
the
simplest
means
first
and
these
lie
undoubtedly
in
an
advertisement
in
all
the
evening
papers
this
fail
i
shall
have
recourse
to
other
methods
will
you
say
me
a
pencil
and
that
slip
of
paper
then
at
the
corner
of
a
goose
and
a
black
felt
hat
can
have
the
same
by
applying
at
this
evening
at
b
is
clear
and
concise
will
he
see
it
he
is
sure
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
papers
since
to
a
poor
man
the
loss
was
a
heavy
one
was
clearly
so
scared
by
his
mischance
in
breaking
the
window
and
by
the
approach
of
that
he
thought
of
nothing
but
flight
but
since
then
he
must
have
bitterly
regretted
the
impulse
which
caused
him
to
drop
his
bird
again
the
introduction
of
his
name
will
cause
him
to
see
it
for
everyone
who
knows
him
will
direct
his
attention
to
it
you
are
run
down
to
the
advertising
agency
and
have
this
put
in
the
evening
papers
which
sir
in
the
s
and
any
others
that
occur
to
you
well
sir
this
stone
yes
i
shall
keep
the
stone
you
i
say
just
buy
a
goose
on
your
way
back
and
leave
it
here
with
me
for
we
must
have
one
to
give
to
this
gentleman
in
place
of
the
one
which
your
family
is
now
devouring
the
commissionaire
had
gone
took
up
the
stone
and
held
it
against
the
light
s
a
bonny
thing
said
he
see
how
it
glints
and
sparkles
course
it
is
a
nucleus
and
focus
of
crime
good
stone
is
are
the
devil
s
pet
baits
the
larger
and
older
jewels
every
facet
may
stand
for
a
bloody
deed
stone
is
not
yet
twenty
years
old
was
found
in
the
banks
of
the
in
southern
and
is
remarkable
in
having
every
characteristic
of
the
carbuncle
save
that
it
is
blue
in
shade
instead
of
ruby
red
spite
of
its
youth
it
has
already
a
sinister
history
have
been
two
murders
a
vitriol
throwing
a
suicide
and
several
robberies
brought
about
for
the
sake
of
this
forty
grain
weight
of
crystallised
charcoal
would
think
that
so
pretty
a
toy
would
be
a
purveyor
to
the
gallows
and
the
prison
i
ll
lock
it
up
in
my
strong
box
now
and
drop
a
line
to
the
to
say
that
we
have
it
you
think
that
this
man
is
innocent
i
cannot
tell
then
do
you
imagine
that
this
other
one
had
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
is
i
think
much
more
likely
that
is
an
absolutely
innocent
man
who
had
no
idea
that
the
bird
which
he
was
carrying
was
of
considerably
more
value
than
if
it
were
made
of
solid
gold
however
i
shall
determine
by
a
very
simple
test
if
we
have
an
answer
to
our
advertisement
you
can
do
nothing
until
then
that
case
i
shall
continue
my
professional
round
i
shall
come
back
in
the
evening
at
the
hour
you
have
mentioned
for
i
should
like
to
see
the
solution
of
so
tangled
a
business
glad
to
see
you
i
dine
at
seven
is
a
woodcock
i
believe
the
way
in
view
of
recent
occurrences
perhaps
i
ought
to
ask
to
examine
its
crop
i
had
been
delayed
at
a
case
and
it
was
a
little
after
half
past
six
when
i
found
myself
in
once
more
i
approached
the
house
i
saw
a
tall
man
in
a
bonnet
with
a
coat
which
was
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
waiting
outside
in
the
bright
semicircle
which
was
thrown
from
the
fanlight
as
i
arrived
the
door
was
opened
and
we
were
shown
up
together
to
room
i
believe
said
he
rising
from
his
armchair
and
greeting
his
visitor
with
the
easy
air
of
geniality
which
he
could
so
readily
assume
take
this
chair
by
the
fire
is
a
cold
night
and
i
observe
that
your
circulation
is
more
adapted
for
summer
than
for
winter
you
have
just
come
at
the
right
time
that
your
hat
sir
that
is
undoubtedly
my
hat
was
a
large
man
with
rounded
shoulders
a
massive
head
and
a
broad
intelligent
face
sloping
down
to
a
pointed
beard
of
grizzled
brown
a
touch
of
red
in
nose
and
cheeks
with
a
slight
tremor
of
his
extended
hand
recalled
surmise
as
to
his
habits
rusty
black
frock
coat
was
buttoned
right
up
in
front
with
the
collar
turned
up
and
his
lank
wrists
protruded
from
his
sleeves
without
a
sign
of
cuff
or
shirt
spoke
in
a
slow
staccato
fashion
choosing
his
words
with
care
and
gave
the
impression
generally
of
a
man
of
learning
and
letters
who
had
had
ill
usage
at
the
hands
of
fortune
have
retained
these
things
for
some
days
said
because
we
expected
to
see
an
advertisement
from
you
giving
your
address
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
now
why
you
did
not
advertise

gave
a
rather
shamefaced
laugh
have
not
been
so
plentiful
with
me
as
they
once
were
he
remarked
i
had
no
doubt
that
the
gang
of
roughs
who
assaulted
me
had
carried
off
both
my
hat
and
the
bird
i
did
not
care
to
spend
more
money
in
a
hopeless
attempt
at
recovering
them
naturally
the
way
about
the
bird
we
were
compelled
to
eat
it

it
visitor
half
rose
from
his
chair
in
his
excitement
it
would
have
been
of
no
use
to
anyone
had
we
not
done
so
i
presume
that
this
other
goose
upon
the
sideboard
which
is
about
the
same
weight
and
perfectly
fresh
will
answer
your
purpose
equally
well
certainly
certainly
answered
with
a
sigh
of
relief
course
we
still
have
the
feathers
legs
crop
and
so
on
of
your
own
bird
so
if
you
wish
man
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
might
be
useful
to
me
as
relics
of
my
adventure
said
he
but
beyond
that
i
can
hardly
see
what
use
the
disjecta
membra
of
my
late
acquaintance
are
going
to
be
to
me
sir
i
think
that
with
your
permission
i
will
confine
my
attentions
to
the
excellent
bird
which
i
perceive
upon
the
sideboard
glanced
sharply
across
at
me
with
a
slight
shrug
of
his
shoulders
is
your
hat
then
and
there
your
bird
said
he
the
way
would
it
bore
you
to
tell
me
where
you
got
the
other
one
from
i
am
somewhat
of
a
fowl
fancier
and
i
have
seldom
seen
a
better
grown
goose
sir
said
who
had
risen
and
tucked
his
newly
gained
property
under
his
arm
are
a
few
of
us
who
frequent
the
near
the
we
are
to
be
found
in
the
itself
during
the
day
you
understand
year
our
good
host
by
name
instituted
a
goose
club
by
which
on
consideration
of
some
few
pence
every
week
we
were
each
to
receive
a
bird
at
pence
were
duly
paid
and
the
rest
is
familiar
to
you
i
am
much
indebted
to
you
sir
for
a
bonnet
is
fitted
neither
to
my
years
nor
my
gravity
a
comical
pomposity
of
manner
he
bowed
solemnly
to
both
of
us
and
strode
off
upon
his
way
much
for
said
when
he
had
closed
the
door
behind
him
is
quite
certain
that
he
knows
nothing
whatever
about
the
matter
you
hungry
particularly
i
suggest
that
we
turn
our
dinner
into
a
supper
and
follow
up
this
clue
while
it
is
still
hot
all
means
was
a
bitter
night
so
we
drew
on
our
ulsters
and
wrapped
cravats
about
our
throats
the
stars
were
shining
coldly
in
a
cloudless
sky
and
the
breath
of
the
passers
by
blew
out
into
smoke
like
so
many
pistol
shots
footfalls
rang
out
crisply
and
loudly
as
we
swung
through
the
doctors
quarter
and
so
through
into
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
in
at
the
which
is
a
small
public
house
at
the
corner
of
one
of
the
streets
which
runs
down
into
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
private
bar
and
ordered
two
glasses
of
beer
from
the
ruddy
faced
white
aproned
landlord
beer
should
be
excellent
if
it
is
as
good
as
your
geese
said
he
geese
man
seemed
surprised
i
was
speaking
only
half
an
hour
ago
to
who
was
a
member
of
your
goose
club
yes
i
see
you
see
sir
them
s
not
our
geese
then
i
got
the
two
dozen
from
a
salesman
in
i
know
some
of
them
was
it
is
his
name
i
don
t
know
him
here
s
your
good
health
landlord
and
prosperity
to
your
house
night
for
he
continued
buttoning
up
his
coat
as
we
came
out
into
the
frosty
air
that
though
we
have
so
homely
a
thing
as
a
goose
at
one
end
of
this
chain
we
have
at
the
other
a
man
who
will
certainly
get
seven
years
penal
servitude
unless
we
can
establish
his
innocence
is
possible
that
our
inquiry
may
but
confirm
his
guilt
but
in
any
case
we
have
a
line
of
investigation
which
has
been
missed
by
the
police
and
which
a
singular
chance
has
placed
in
our
hands
us
follow
it
out
to
the
bitter
end
to
the
south
then
and
quick
march
passed
across
down
and
so
through
a
zigzag
of
slums
to
of
the
largest
stalls
bore
the
name
of
upon
it
and
the
proprietor
a
horsey
looking
man
with
a
sharp
face
and
trim
side
whiskers
was
helping
a
boy
to
put
up
the
shutters
evening
s
a
cold
night
said
salesman
nodded
and
shot
a
questioning
glance
at
my
companion
out
of
geese
i
see
continued
pointing
at
the
bare
slabs
of
marble
you
have
five
hundred
to
morrow
morning
s
no
good
there
are
some
on
the
stall
with
the
gas
flare
but
i
was
recommended
to
you
by
landlord
of
the
yes
i
sent
him
a
couple
of
dozen
birds
they
were
too
where
did
you
get
them
from
my
surprise
the
question
provoked
a
burst
of
anger
from
the
salesman
then
mister
said
he
with
his
head
cocked
and
his
arms
akimbo
what
are
you
driving
at
s
have
it
straight
now
is
straight
enough
i
should
like
to
know
who
sold
you
the
geese
which
you
supplied
to
the
then
i
shan
t
tell
you
now
it
is
a
matter
of
no
importance
but
i
don
t
know
why
you
should
be
so
warm
over
such
a
trifle
d
be
as
warm
maybe
if
you
were
as
pestered
as
i
am
i
pay
good
money
for
a
good
article
there
should
be
an
end
of
the
business
but
it
s
are
the
geese
and
did
you
sell
the
geese
to
and
will
you
take
for
the
geese
would
think
they
were
the
only
geese
in
the
world
to
hear
the
fuss
that
is
made
over
them
i
have
no
connection
with
any
other
people
who
have
been
making
inquiries
said
carelessly
you
won
t
tell
us
the
bet
is
off
that
is
all
i
m
always
ready
to
back
my
opinion
on
a
matter
of
fowls
and
i
have
a
fiver
on
it
that
the
bird
i
ate
is
country
bred
then
you
ve
lost
your
fiver
for
it
s
town
bred
snapped
the
salesman
s
nothing
of
the
kind
i
say
it
is
i
don
t
believe
it
d
you
think
you
know
more
about
fowls
than
i
who
have
handled
them
ever
since
i
was
a
nipper
i
tell
you
all
those
birds
that
went
to
the
were
town
bred
ll
never
persuade
me
to
believe
that
you
bet
then
s
merely
taking
your
money
for
i
know
that
i
am
right
i
ll
have
a
sovereign
on
with
you
just
to
teach
you
not
to
be
obstinate
salesman
chuckled
grimly
me
the
books
said
he
small
boy
brought
round
a
small
thin
volume
and
a
great
greasy
backed
one
laying
them
out
together
beneath
the
hanging
lamp
then
said
the
salesman
i
thought
that
i
was
out
of
geese
but
before
i
finish
you
ll
find
that
there
is
still
one
left
in
my
shop
see
this
little
book
s
the
list
of
the
folk
from
whom
i
buy
d
you
see
then
here
on
this
page
are
the
country
folk
and
the
numbers
after
their
names
are
where
their
accounts
are
in
the
big
ledger
then
see
this
other
page
in
red
ink
that
is
a
list
of
my
town
suppliers
look
at
that
third
name
read
it
out
to
me
read
so
turn
that
up
in
the
ledger
turned
to
the
page
indicated
you
are
egg
and
poultry
supplier
then
what
s
the
last
entry
nd
four
geese
at
s
d
so
you
are
underneath
to
of
the
at
s
have
you
to
say
now
looked
deeply
chagrined
drew
a
sovereign
from
his
pocket
and
threw
it
down
upon
the
slab
turning
away
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
disgust
is
too
deep
for
words
a
few
yards
off
he
stopped
under
a
lamp
post
and
laughed
in
the
hearty
noiseless
fashion
which
was
peculiar
to
him
you
see
a
man
with
whiskers
of
that
cut
and
the
un
protruding
out
of
his
pocket
you
can
always
draw
him
by
a
bet
said
he
i
daresay
that
if
i
had
put
pounds
down
in
front
of
him
that
man
would
not
have
given
me
such
complete
information
as
was
drawn
from
him
by
the
idea
that
he
was
doing
me
on
a
wager
we
are
i
fancy
nearing
the
end
of
our
quest
and
the
only
point
which
remains
to
be
determined
is
whether
we
should
go
on
to
this
to
night
or
whether
we
should
reserve
it
for
to
morrow
is
clear
from
what
that
surly
fellow
said
that
there
are
others
besides
ourselves
who
are
anxious
about
the
matter
and
i
should
remarks
were
suddenly
cut
short
by
a
loud
hubbub
which
broke
out
from
the
stall
which
we
had
just
left
round
we
saw
a
little
rat
faced
fellow
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
of
yellow
light
which
was
thrown
by
the
swinging
lamp
while
the
salesman
framed
in
the
door
of
his
stall
was
shaking
his
fists
fiercely
at
the
cringing
figure
i
ve
had
enough
of
you
and
your
geese
he
shouted
i
wish
you
were
all
at
the
devil
together
you
come
pestering
me
any
more
with
your
silly
talk
i
ll
set
the
dog
at
you
bring
here
and
i
ll
answer
her
but
what
have
you
to
do
with
it
i
buy
the
geese
off
you
but
one
of
them
was
mine
all
the
same
whined
the
little
man
then
ask
for
it
told
me
to
ask
you
you
can
ask
the
of
for
all
i
care
i
ve
had
enough
of
it
out
of
this
rushed
fiercely
forward
and
the
inquirer
flitted
away
into
the
darkness
this
may
save
us
a
visit
to
whispered
with
me
and
we
will
see
what
is
to
be
made
of
this
fellow
through
the
scattered
knots
of
people
who
lounged
round
the
flaring
stalls
my
companion
speedily
overtook
the
little
man
and
touched
him
upon
the
shoulder
sprang
round
and
i
could
see
in
the
gas
light
that
every
vestige
of
colour
had
been
driven
from
his
face

you
want

asked
in
a
quavering
voice
will
excuse
me
said
blandly
but
i
could
not
help
overhearing
the
questions
which
you
put
to
the
salesman
just
now
i
think
that
i
could
be
of
assistance

you

to
trace
some
geese

were
sold
by

the
little
fellow
with
outstretched
hands
and
quivering
fingers

can
hardly
explain
to
you
how
interested
i
am
in
this
matter

a
four
wheeler
which
was
passing
that
case
we
had
better
discuss
it
in
a
cosy
room
rather
than
in
this
wind
swept
market
place
said
he
pray
tell
me
before
we
go
farther

awkward

business
with

a
flush
sprang
to
the
white
cheeks
of
the
stranger

into

glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
half
frightened
half
hopeful
eyes
as
one
who
is
not
sure
whether
he
is
on
the
verge
of
a
windfall
or
of
a
catastrophe

stepped

the
high
thin
breathing
of
our
new
companion
and
the
claspings
and
unclaspings
of
his
hands

yours
then
want
to
know
what
became
of
those

most
remarkable
bird

visitor
staggered
to
his
feet
and
clutched
the
mantelpiece
with
his
right
hand
unlocked
his
strong
box
and
held
up
the
blue
carbuncle
which
shone
out
like
a
star
with
a
cold
brilliant
many
pointed
radiance
stood
glaring
with
a
drawn
face
uncertain
whether
to
claim
or
to
disown

you

into

with
impunity
him
a
dash
of
brandy
he
looks
a
little
more
human
a
shrimp
it
is
to
be
sure
a
moment
he
had
staggered
and
nearly
fallen
but
the
brandy
brought
a
tinge
of
colour
into
his
cheeks
and
he
sat
staring
with
frightened
eyes
at
his
accuser

almost
every
link
in
my
hands
and
all
the
proofs
which
i
could
possibly
need
so
there
is
little
which
you
need
tell
me
that
little
may
as
well
be
cleared
up
to
make
the
case
complete
had
heard
of
this
blue
stone
of
the
of
s
was
who
told
me
of
it
said

in
a
crackling
voice
i
see
her
ladyship
s
waiting
maid
the
temptation
of
sudden
wealth
so
easily
acquired
was
too
much
for
you
as
it
has
been
for
better
men
before
you
but
you
were
not
very
scrupulous
in
the
means
you
used
seems
to
me
that
there
is
the
making
of
a
very
pretty
villain
in
you
knew
that
this
man
the
plumber
had
been
concerned
in
some
such
matter
before
and
that
suspicion
would
rest
the
more
readily
upon
him
did
you
do
then
made
some
small
job
in
my
lady
s
room
you
and
your
confederate
and
you
managed
that
he
should
be
the
man
sent
for
when
he
had
left
you
rifled
the
jewel
case
raised
the
alarm
and
had
this
unfortunate
man
arrested
then
threw
himself
down
suddenly
upon
the
rug
and
clutched
at
my
companion
s
knees
s
sake
have
mercy
he
shrieked
of
my
father
my
mother
would
break
their
hearts
i
never
went
wrong
before
i
never
will
again
i
swear
it
i

swear
it
on
a
don

bring
it
into
court

sake
don
t
back
into
your
chair
said
sternly
is
very
well
to
cringe
and
crawl
now
but
you
thought
little
enough
of
this
poor
in
the
dock
for
a
crime
of
which
he
knew
nothing
i
will
fly
i
will
leave
the
country
sir
the
charge
against
him
will
break
down
will
talk
about
that
now
let
us
hear
a
true
account
of
the
next
act
came
the
stone
into
the
goose
and
how
came
the
goose
into
the
open
market
us
the
truth
for
there
lies
your
only
hope
of
safety
passed
his
tongue
over
his
parched
lips
i
will
tell
you
it
just
as
it
happened
sir
said
he
had
been
arrested
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
get
away
with
the
stone
at
once
for
i
did
not
know
at
what
moment
the
police
might
not
take
it
into
their
heads
to
search
me
and
my
room
was
no
place
about
the
hotel
where
it
would
be
safe
i
went
out
as
if
on
some
commission
and
i
made
for
my
sister
s
house
had
married
a
man
named
and
lived
in
where
she
fattened
fowls
for
the
market
the
way
there
every
man
i
met
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
policeman
or
a
detective
and
for
all
that
it
was
a
cold
night
the
sweat
was
pouring
down
my
face
before
i
came
to
the
sister
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
and
why
i
was
so
pale
but
i
told
her
that
i
had
been
upset
by
the
jewel
robbery
at
the
hotel
i
went
into
the
back
yard
and
smoked
a
pipe
and
wondered
what
it
would
be
best
to
do
i
had
a
friend
once
called
who
went
to
the
bad
and
has
just
been
serving
his
time
in
day
he
had
met
me
and
fell
into
talk
about
the
ways
of
thieves
and
how
they
could
get
rid
of
what
they
stole
i
knew
that
he
would
be
true
to
me
for
i
knew
one
or
two
things
about
him
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
right
on
to
where
he
lived
and
take
him
into
my
confidence
would
show
me
how
to
turn
the
stone
into
money
how
to
get
to
him
in
safety
i
thought
of
the
agonies
i
had
gone
through
in
coming
from
the
hotel
i
might
at
any
moment
be
seized
and
searched
and
there
would
be
the
stone
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
i
was
leaning
against
the
wall
at
the
time
and
looking
at
the
geese
which
were
waddling
about
round
my
feet
and
suddenly
an
idea
came
into
my
head
which
showed
me
how
i
could
beat
the
best
detective
that
ever
lived
sister
had
told
me
some
weeks
before
that
i
might
have
the
pick
of
her
geese
for
a
present
and
i
knew
that
she
was
always
as
good
as
her
word
i
would
take
my
goose
now
and
in
it
i
would
carry
my
stone
to
was
a
little
shed
in
the
yard
and
behind
this
i
drove
one
of
the
birds
a
fine
big
one
white
with
a
barred
tail
i
caught
it
and
prying
its
bill
open
i
thrust
the
stone
down
its
throat
as
far
as
my
finger
could
reach
bird
gave
a
gulp
and
i
felt
the
stone
pass
along
its
gullet
and
down
into
its
crop
the
creature
flapped
and
struggled
and
out
came
my
sister
to
know
what
was
the
matter
i
turned
to
speak
to
her
the
brute
broke
loose
and
fluttered
off
among
the
others
were
you
doing
with
that
bird
says
she
said
i
you
said
you
d
give
me
one
for
and
i
was
feeling
which
was
the
fattest
says
she
we
ve
set
yours
aside
for
you
s
bird
we
call
it
s
the
big
white
one
over
yonder
s
twenty
six
of
them
which
makes
one
for
you
and
one
for
us
and
two
dozen
for
the
market
you
says
i
but
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
i
d
rather
have
that
one
i
was
handling
just
now
other
is
a
good
three
pound
heavier
said
she
and
we
fattened
it
expressly
for
you
mind
i
ll
have
the
other
and
i
ll
take
it
now
said
i
just
as
you
like
said
she
a
little
huffed
is
it
you
want
then
white
one
with
the
barred
tail
right
in
the
middle
of
the
flock
very
well
it
and
take
it
with
you
i
did
what
she
said
and
i
carried
the
bird
all
the
way
to
i
told
my
pal
what
i
had
done
for
he
was
a
man
that
it
was
easy
to
tell
a
thing
like
that
to
laughed
until
he
choked
and
we
got
a
knife
and
opened
the
goose
heart
turned
to
water
for
there
was
no
sign
of
the
stone
and
i
knew
that
some
terrible
mistake
had
occurred
i
left
the
bird
rushed
back
to
my
sister
s
and
hurried
into
the
back
yard
was
not
a
bird
to
be
seen
there
are
they
all
i
cried
to
the
dealer
s
dealer
s
of
was
there
another
with
a
barred
tail
i
asked
the
same
as
the
one
i
chose
there
were
two
barred
tailed
ones
and
i
could
never
tell
them
apart
then
of
course
i
saw
it
all
and
i
ran
off
as
hard
as
my
feet
would
carry
me
to
this
man
but
he
had
sold
the
lot
at
once
and
not
one
word
would
he
tell
me
as
to
where
they
had
gone
heard
him
yourselves
to
night
he
has
always
answered
me
like
that
sister
thinks
that
i
am
going
mad
i
think
that
i
am
myself
now
and
now
i
am
myself
a
branded
thief
without
ever
having
touched
the
wealth
for
which
i
sold
my
character
help
me
help
me
burst
into
convulsive
sobbing
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
was
a
long
silence
broken
only
by
his
heavy
breathing
and
by
the
measured
tapping
of
finger
tips
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
my
friend
rose
and
threw
open
the
door
out
said
he
sir
bless
you
more
words
out
no
more
words
were
needed
was
a
rush
a
clatter
upon
the
stairs
the
bang
of
a
door
and
the
crisp
rattle
of
running
footfalls
from
the
street
all
said
reaching
up
his
hand
for
his
clay
pipe
i
am
not
retained
by
the
police
to
supply
their
deficiencies
were
in
danger
it
would
be
another
thing
but
this
fellow
will
not
appear
against
him
and
the
case
must
collapse
i
suppose
that
i
am
commuting
a
felony
but
it
is
just
possible
that
i
am
saving
a
soul
fellow
will
not
go
wrong
again
he
is
too
terribly
frightened
him
to
gaol
now
and
you
make
him
a
gaol
bird
for
life
it
is
the
season
of
forgiveness
has
put
in
our
way
a
most
singular
and
whimsical
problem
and
its
solution
is
its
own
reward
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
touch
the
bell
we
will
begin
another
investigation
in
which
also
a
bird
will
be
the
chief
feature
viii
the
adventure
of
the
speckled
band
glancing
over
my
notes
of
the
seventy
odd
cases
in
which
i
have
during
the
last
eight
years
studied
the
methods
of
my
friend
i
find
many
tragic
some
comic
a
large
number
merely
strange
but
none
commonplace
for
working
as
he
did
rather
for
the
love
of
his
art
than
for
the
acquirement
of
wealth
he
refused
to
associate
himself
with
any
investigation
which
did
not
tend
towards
the
unusual
and
even
the
fantastic
all
these
varied
cases
however
i
cannot
recall
any
which
presented
more
singular
features
than
that
which
was
associated
with
the
well
known
family
of
the
of
events
in
question
occurred
in
the
early
days
of
my
association
with
when
we
were
sharing
rooms
as
bachelors
in
is
possible
that
i
might
have
placed
them
upon
record
before
but
a
promise
of
secrecy
was
made
at
the
time
from
which
i
have
only
been
freed
during
the
last
month
by
the
untimely
death
of
the
lady
to
whom
the
pledge
was
given
is
perhaps
as
well
that
the
facts
should
now
come
to
light
for
i
have
reasons
to
know
that
there
are
widespread
rumours
as
to
the
death
of
which
tend
to
make
the
matter
even
more
terrible
than
the
truth
was
early
in
in
the
year
that
i
woke
one
morning
to
find
standing
fully
dressed
by
the
side
of
my
bed
was
a
late
riser
as
a
rule
and
as
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
showed
me
that
it
was
only
a
quarter
past
seven
i
blinked
up
at
him
in
some
surprise
and
perhaps
just
a
little
resentment
for
i
was
myself
regular
in
my
habits
sorry
to
knock
you
up
said
he
but
it
s
the
common
lot
this
morning
has
been
knocked
up
she
retorted
upon
me
and
i
on
you
is
it
then
a
fire
a
client
seems
that
a
young
lady
has
arrived
in
a
considerable
state
of
excitement
who
insists
upon
seeing
me
is
waiting
now
in
the
sitting
room
when
young
ladies
wander
about
the
metropolis
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
and
knock
sleepy
people
up
out
of
their
beds
i
presume
that
it
is
something
very
pressing
which
they
have
to
communicate
it
prove
to
be
an
interesting
case
you
would
i
am
sure
wish
to
follow
it
from
the
outset
i
thought
at
any
rate
that
i
should
call
you
and
give
you
the
chance
dear
fellow
i
would
not
miss
it
for
anything
i
had
no
keener
pleasure
than
in
following
in
his
professional
investigations
and
in
admiring
the
rapid
deductions
as
swift
as
intuitions
and
yet
always
founded
on
a
logical
basis
with
which
he
unravelled
the
problems
which
were
submitted
to
him
i
rapidly
threw
on
my
clothes
and
was
ready
in
a
few
minutes
to
accompany
my
friend
down
to
the
sitting
room
a
lady
dressed
in
black
and
heavily
veiled
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
window
rose
as
we
entered
morning
madam
said
cheerily
name
is
is
my
intimate
friend
and
associate
before
whom
you
can
speak
as
freely
as
before
myself
i
am
glad
to
see
that
has
had
the
good
sense
to
light
the
fire
draw
up
to
it
and
i
shall
order
you
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
for
i
observe
that
you
are
shivering
is
not
cold
which
makes
me
shiver
said
the
woman
in
a
low
voice
changing
her
seat
as
requested
then
is
fear
is
terror
raised
her
veil
as
she
spoke
and
we
could
see
that
she
was
indeed
in
a
pitiable
state
of
agitation
her
face
all
drawn
and
grey
with
restless
frightened
eyes
like
those
of
some
hunted
animal
features
and
figure
were
those
of
a
woman
of
thirty
but
her
hair
was
shot
with
premature
grey
and
her
expression
was
weary
and
haggard
ran
her
over
with
one
of
his
quick
all
comprehensive
glances
must
not
fear
said
he
soothingly
bending
forward
and
patting
her
forearm
shall
soon
set
matters
right
i
have
no
doubt
have
come
in
by
train
this
morning
i
see
know
me
then
but
i
observe
the
second
half
of
a
return
ticket
in
the
palm
of
your
left
glove
must
have
started
early
and
yet
you
had
a
good
drive
in
a
dog
cart
along
heavy
roads
before
you
reached
the
station
lady
gave
a
violent
start
and
stared
in
bewilderment
at
my
companion
is
no
mystery
my
dear
madam
said
he
smiling
left
arm
of
your
jacket
is
spattered
with
mud
in
no
less
than
seven
places
marks
are
perfectly
fresh
is
no
vehicle
save
a
dog
cart
which
throws
up
mud
in
that
way
and
then
only
when
you
sit
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
driver
your
reasons
may
be
you
are
perfectly
correct
said
she
i
started
from
home
before
six
reached
at
twenty
past
and
came
in
by
the
first
train
to
i
can
stand
this
strain
no
longer
i
shall
go
mad
if
it
continues
i
have
no
one
to
turn
to
none
save
only
one
who
cares
for
me
and
he
poor
fellow
can
be
of
little
aid
i
have
heard
of
you
i
have
heard
of
you
from
whom
you
helped
in
the
hour
of
her
sore
need
was
from
her
that
i
had
your
address
sir
do
you
not
think
that
you
could
help
me
too
and
at
least
throw
a
little
light
through
the
dense
darkness
which
surrounds
me
present
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
reward
you
for
your
services
but
in
a
month
or
six
weeks
i
shall
be
married
with
the
control
of
my
own
income
and
then
at
least
you
shall
not
find
me
ungrateful
turned
to
his
desk
and
unlocking
it
drew
out
a
small
case
book
which
he
consulted
said
he
yes
i
recall
the
case
it
was
concerned
with
an
opal
tiara
i
think
it
was
before
your
time
i
can
only
say
madam
that
i
shall
be
happy
to
devote
the
same
care
to
your
case
as
i
did
to
that
of
your
friend
to
reward
my
profession
is
its
own
reward
but
you
are
at
liberty
to
defray
whatever
expenses
i
may
be
put
to
at
the
time
which
suits
you
best
now
i
beg
that
you
will
lay
before
us
everything
that
may
help
us
in
forming
an
opinion
upon
the
matter
replied
our
visitor
the
very
horror
of
my
situation
lies
in
the
fact
that
my
fears
are
so
vague
and
my
suspicions
depend
so
entirely
upon
small
points
which
might
seem
trivial
to
another
that
even
he
to
whom
of
all
others
i
have
a
right
to
look
for
help
and
advice
looks
upon
all
that
i
tell
him
about
it
as
the
fancies
of
a
nervous
woman
does
not
say
so
but
i
can
read
it
from
his
soothing
answers
and
averted
eyes
i
have
heard
that
you
can
see
deeply
into
the
manifold
wickedness
of
the
human
heart
may
advise
me
how
to
walk
amid
the
dangers
which
encompass
me
i
am
all
attention
madam
name
is
and
i
am
living
with
my
stepfather
who
is
the
last
survivor
of
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
the
of
on
the
western
border
of
nodded
his
head
name
is
familiar
to
me
said
he
family
was
at
one
time
among
the
richest
in
and
the
estates
extended
over
the
borders
into
in
the
north
and
in
the
west
the
last
century
however
four
successive
heirs
were
of
a
dissolute
and
wasteful
disposition
and
the
family
ruin
was
eventually
completed
by
a
gambler
in
the
days
of
the
was
left
save
a
few
acres
of
ground
and
the
two
hundred
year
old
house
which
is
itself
crushed
under
a
heavy
mortgage
last
squire
dragged
out
his
existence
there
living
the
horrible
life
of
an
aristocratic
pauper
but
his
only
son
my
stepfather
seeing
that
he
must
adapt
himself
to
the
new
conditions
obtained
an
advance
from
a
relative
which
enabled
him
to
take
a
medical
degree
and
went
out
to
where
by
his
professional
skill
and
his
force
of
character
he
established
a
large
practice
a
fit
of
anger
however
caused
by
some
robberies
which
had
been
perpetrated
in
the
house
he
beat
his
native
butler
to
death
and
narrowly
escaped
a
capital
sentence
it
was
he
suffered
a
long
term
of
imprisonment
and
afterwards
returned
to
a
morose
and
disappointed
man
was
in
he
married
my
mother
the
young
widow
of
of
the
sister
and
i
were
twins
and
we
were
only
two
years
old
at
the
time
of
my
mother
s
re
marriage
had
a
considerable
sum
of
money
not
less
than
pounds
a
year
and
this
she
bequeathed
to
entirely
while
we
resided
with
him
with
a
provision
that
a
certain
annual
sum
should
be
allowed
to
each
of
us
in
the
event
of
our
marriage
after
our
return
to
my
mother
died
she
was
killed
eight
years
ago
in
a
railway
accident
near
then
abandoned
his
attempts
to
establish
himself
in
practice
in
and
took
us
to
live
with
him
in
the
old
ancestral
house
at
money
which
my
mother
had
left
was
enough
for
all
our
wants
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
obstacle
to
our
happiness
a
terrible
change
came
over
our
stepfather
about
this
time
of
making
friends
and
exchanging
visits
with
our
neighbours
who
had
at
first
been
overjoyed
to
see
a
of
back
in
the
old
family
seat
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
house
and
seldom
came
out
save
to
indulge
in
ferocious
quarrels
with
whoever
might
cross
his
path
of
temper
approaching
to
mania
has
been
hereditary
in
the
men
of
the
family
and
in
my
stepfather
s
case
it
had
i
believe
been
intensified
by
his
long
residence
in
the
tropics
a
series
of
disgraceful
brawls
took
place
two
of
which
ended
in
the
police
court
until
at
last
he
became
the
terror
of
the
village
and
the
folks
would
fly
at
his
approach
for
he
is
a
man
of
immense
strength
and
absolutely
uncontrollable
in
his
anger
week
he
hurled
the
local
blacksmith
over
a
parapet
into
a
stream
and
it
was
only
by
paying
over
all
the
money
which
i
could
gather
together
that
i
was
able
to
avert
another
public
exposure
had
no
friends
at
all
save
the
wandering
gipsies
and
he
would
give
these
vagabonds
leave
to
encamp
upon
the
few
acres
of
bramble
covered
land
which
represent
the
family
estate
and
would
accept
in
return
the
hospitality
of
their
tents
wandering
away
with
them
sometimes
for
weeks
on
end
has
a
passion
also
for
animals
which
are
sent
over
to
him
by
a
correspondent
and
he
has
at
this
moment
a
cheetah
and
a
baboon
which
wander
freely
over
his
grounds
and
are
feared
by
the
villagers
almost
as
much
as
their
master
can
imagine
from
what
i
say
that
my
poor
sister
and
i
had
no
great
pleasure
in
our
lives
servant
would
stay
with
us
and
for
a
long
time
we
did
all
the
work
of
the
house
was
but
thirty
at
the
time
of
her
death
and
yet
her
hair
had
already
begun
to
whiten
even
as
mine
has
sister
is
dead
then
died
just
two
years
ago
and
it
is
of
her
death
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
can
understand
that
living
the
life
which
i
have
described
we
were
little
likely
to
see
anyone
of
our
own
age
and
position
had
however
an
aunt
my
mother
s
maiden
sister
who
lives
near
and
we
were
occasionally
allowed
to
pay
short
visits
at
this
lady
s
house
went
there
at
two
years
ago
and
met
there
a
half
pay
major
of
marines
to
whom
she
became
engaged
stepfather
learned
of
the
engagement
when
my
sister
returned
and
offered
no
objection
to
the
marriage
but
within
a
fortnight
of
the
day
which
had
been
fixed
for
the
wedding
the
terrible
event
occurred
which
has
deprived
me
of
my
only
companion
had
been
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
head
sunk
in
a
cushion
but
he
half
opened
his
lids
now
and
glanced
across
at
his
visitor
be
precise
as
to
details
said
he
is
easy
for
me
to
be
so
for
every
event
of
that
dreadful
time
is
seared
into
my
memory
manor
house
is
as
i
have
already
said
very
old
and
only
one
wing
is
now
inhabited
bedrooms
in
this
wing
are
on
the
ground
floor
the
sitting
rooms
being
in
the
central
block
of
the
buildings
these
bedrooms
the
first
is
s
the
second
my
sister
s
and
the
third
my
own
is
no
communication
between
them
but
they
all
open
out
into
the
same
corridor
i
make
myself
plain
so
windows
of
the
three
rooms
open
out
upon
the
lawn
fatal
night
had
gone
to
his
room
early
though
we
knew
that
he
had
not
retired
to
rest
for
my
sister
was
troubled
by
the
smell
of
the
strong
cigars
which
it
was
his
custom
to
smoke
left
her
room
therefore
and
came
into
mine
where
she
sat
for
some
time
chatting
about
her
approaching
wedding
eleven
o
clock
she
rose
to
leave
me
but
she
paused
at
the
door
and
looked
back
me
said
she
have
you
ever
heard
anyone
whistle
in
the
dead
of
the
night
said
i
i
suppose
that
you
could
not
possibly
whistle
yourself
in
your
sleep
not
why
during
the
last
few
nights
i
have
always
about
three
in
the
morning
heard
a
low
clear
whistle
i
am
a
light
sleeper
and
it
has
awakened
me
i
cannot
tell
where
it
came
from
perhaps
from
the
next
room
perhaps
from
the
lawn
i
thought
that
i
would
just
ask
you
whether
you
had
heard
it
i
have
not
must
be
those
wretched
gipsies
in
the
plantation
likely
yet
if
it
were
on
the
lawn
i
wonder
that
you
did
not
hear
it
also
but
i
sleep
more
heavily
than
you
it
is
of
no
great
consequence
at
any
rate
smiled
back
at
me
closed
my
door
and
a
few
moments
later
i
heard
her
key
turn
in
the
lock
said
it
your
custom
always
to
lock
yourselves
in
at
night
why
i
think
that
i
mentioned
to
you
that
the
doctor
kept
a
cheetah
and
a
baboon
had
no
feeling
of
security
unless
our
doors
were
locked
so
proceed
with
your
statement
i
could
not
sleep
that
night
a
vague
feeling
of
impending
misfortune
impressed
me
sister
and
i
you
will
recollect
were
twins
and
you
know
how
subtle
are
the
links
which
bind
two
souls
which
are
so
closely
allied
was
a
wild
night
wind
was
howling
outside
and
the
rain
was
beating
and
splashing
against
the
windows
amid
all
the
hubbub
of
the
gale
there
burst
forth
the
wild
scream
of
a
terrified
woman
i
knew
that
it
was
my
sister
s
voice
i
sprang
from
my
bed
wrapped
a
shawl
round
me
and
rushed
into
the
corridor
i
opened
my
door
i
seemed
to
hear
a
low
whistle
such
as
my
sister
described
and
a
few
moments
later
a
clanging
sound
as
if
a
mass
of
metal
had
fallen
i
ran
down
the
passage
my
sister
s
door
was
unlocked
and
revolved
slowly
upon
its
hinges
i
stared
at
it
horror
stricken
not
knowing
what
was
about
to
issue
from
it
the
light
of
the
corridor
lamp
i
saw
my
sister
appear
at
the
opening
her
face
blanched
with
terror
her
hands
groping
for
help
her
whole
figure
swaying
to
and
fro
like
that
of
a
drunkard
i
ran
to
her
and
threw
my
arms
round
her
but
at
that
moment
her
knees
seemed
to
give
way
and
she
fell
to
the
ground
writhed
as
one
who
is
in
terrible
pain
and
her
limbs
were
dreadfully
convulsed
first
i
thought
that
she
had
not
recognised
me
but
as
i
bent
over
her
she
suddenly
shrieked
out
in
a
voice
which
i
shall
never
forget
my
was
the
band
speckled
band
was
something
else
which
she
would
fain
have
said
and
she
stabbed
with
her
finger
into
the
air
in
the
direction
of
the
doctor
s
room
but
a
fresh
convulsion
seized
her
and
choked
her
words
i
rushed
out
calling
loudly
for
my
stepfather
and
i
met
him
hastening
from
his
room
in
his
dressing
gown
he
reached
my
sister
s
side
she
was
unconscious
and
though
he
poured
brandy
down
her
throat
and
sent
for
medical
aid
from
the
village
all
efforts
were
in
vain
for
she
slowly
sank
and
died
without
having
recovered
her
consciousness
was
the
dreadful
end
of
my
beloved
sister
moment
said
are
you
sure
about
this
whistle
and
metallic
sound
you
swear
to
it
was
what
the
county
coroner
asked
me
at
the
inquiry
is
my
strong
impression
that
i
heard
it
and
yet
among
the
crash
of
the
gale
and
the
creaking
of
an
old
house
i
may
possibly
have
been
deceived
your
sister
dressed
she
was
in
her
night
dress
her
right
hand
was
found
the
charred
stump
of
a
match
and
in
her
left
a
match
box
that
she
had
struck
a
light
and
looked
about
her
when
the
alarm
took
place
is
important
what
conclusions
did
the
coroner
come
to
investigated
the
case
with
great
care
for
s
conduct
had
long
been
notorious
in
the
county
but
he
was
unable
to
find
any
satisfactory
cause
of
death
evidence
showed
that
the
door
had
been
fastened
upon
the
inner
side
and
the
windows
were
blocked
by
old
fashioned
shutters
with
broad
iron
bars
which
were
secured
every
night
walls
were
carefully
sounded
and
were
shown
to
be
quite
solid
all
round
and
the
flooring
was
also
thoroughly
examined
with
the
same
result
chimney
is
wide
but
is
barred
up
by
four
large
staples
is
certain
therefore
that
my
sister
was
quite
alone
when
she
met
her
end
there
were
no
marks
of
any
violence
upon
her
about
poison
doctors
examined
her
for
it
but
without
success
do
you
think
that
this
unfortunate
lady
died
of
then
is
my
belief
that
she
died
of
pure
fear
and
nervous
shock
though
what
it
was
that
frightened
her
i
cannot
imagine
there
gipsies
in
the
plantation
at
the
time
there
are
nearly
always
some
there
and
what
did
you
gather
from
this
allusion
to
a
band
a
speckled
band
i
have
thought
that
it
was
merely
the
wild
talk
of
delirium
sometimes
that
it
may
have
referred
to
some
band
of
people
perhaps
to
these
very
gipsies
in
the
plantation
i
do
not
know
whether
the
spotted
handkerchiefs
which
so
many
of
them
wear
over
their
heads
might
have
suggested
the
strange
adjective
which
she
used
shook
his
head
like
a
man
who
is
far
from
being
satisfied
are
very
deep
waters
said
he
pray
go
on
with
your
narrative
years
have
passed
since
then
and
my
life
has
been
until
lately
lonelier
than
ever
a
month
ago
however
a
dear
friend
whom
i
have
known
for
many
years
has
done
me
the
honour
to
ask
my
hand
in
marriage
name
is
the
second
son
of
of
near
stepfather
has
offered
no
opposition
to
the
match
and
we
are
to
be
married
in
the
course
of
the
spring
days
ago
some
repairs
were
started
in
the
west
wing
of
the
building
and
my
bedroom
wall
has
been
pierced
so
that
i
have
had
to
move
into
the
chamber
in
which
my
sister
died
and
to
sleep
in
the
very
bed
in
which
she
slept
then
my
thrill
of
terror
when
last
night
as
i
lay
awake
thinking
over
her
terrible
fate
i
suddenly
heard
in
the
silence
of
the
night
the
low
whistle
which
had
been
the
herald
of
her
own
death
i
sprang
up
and
lit
the
lamp
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
in
the
room
i
was
too
shaken
to
go
to
bed
again
however
so
i
dressed
and
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
i
slipped
down
got
a
dog
cart
at
the
which
is
opposite
and
drove
to
from
whence
i
have
come
on
this
morning
with
the
one
object
of
seeing
you
and
asking
your
advice
have
done
wisely
said
my
friend
have
you
told
me
all
all
you
have
not
are
screening
your
stepfather
what
do
you
mean
answer
pushed
back
the
frill
of
black
lace
which
fringed
the
hand
that
lay
upon
our
visitor
s
knee
little
livid
spots
the
marks
of
four
fingers
and
a
thumb
were
printed
upon
the
white
wrist
have
been
cruelly
used
said
lady
coloured
deeply
and
covered
over
her
injured
wrist
is
a
hard
man
she
said
and
perhaps
he
hardly
knows
his
own
strength
was
a
long
silence
during
which
leaned
his
chin
upon
his
hands
and
stared
into
the
crackling
fire
is
a
very
deep
business
he
said
at
last
are
a
thousand
details
which
i
should
desire
to
know
before
i
decide
upon
our
course
of
action
we
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
we
were
to
come
to
to
day
would
it
be
possible
for
us
to
see
over
these
rooms
without
the
knowledge
of
your
stepfather
it
happens
he
spoke
of
coming
into
town
to
day
upon
some
most
important
business
is
probable
that
he
will
be
away
all
day
and
that
there
would
be
nothing
to
disturb
you
have
a
housekeeper
now
but
she
is
old
and
foolish
and
i
could
easily
get
her
out
of
the
way
are
not
averse
to
this
trip
no
means
we
shall
both
come
are
you
going
to
do
yourself
i
have
one
or
two
things
which
i
would
wish
to
do
now
that
i
am
in
town
i
shall
return
by
the
twelve
o
clock
train
so
as
to
be
there
in
time
for
your
coming
you
may
expect
us
early
in
the
afternoon
i
have
myself
some
small
business
matters
to
attend
to
you
not
wait
and
breakfast
i
must
go
heart
is
lightened
already
since
i
have
confided
my
trouble
to
you
i
shall
look
forward
to
seeing
you
again
this
afternoon
dropped
her
thick
black
veil
over
her
face
and
glided
from
the
room
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
asked
leaning
back
in
his
chair
seems
to
me
to
be
a
most
dark
and
sinister
business
enough
and
sinister
enough
if
the
lady
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
flooring
and
walls
are
sound
and
that
the
door
window
and
chimney
are
impassable
then
her
sister
must
have
been
undoubtedly
alone
when
she
met
her
mysterious
end
becomes
then
of
these
nocturnal
whistles
and
what
of
the
very
peculiar
words
of
the
dying
woman
i
cannot
think
you
combine
the
ideas
of
whistles
at
night
the
presence
of
a
band
of
gipsies
who
are
on
intimate
terms
with
this
old
doctor
the
fact
that
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
doctor
has
an
interest
in
preventing
his
stepdaughter
s
marriage
the
dying
allusion
to
a
band
and
finally
the
fact
that
heard
a
metallic
clang
which
might
have
been
caused
by
one
of
those
metal
bars
that
secured
the
shutters
falling
back
into
its
place
i
think
that
there
is
good
ground
to
think
that
the
mystery
may
be
cleared
along
those
lines
what
then
did
the
gipsies
do
i
cannot
imagine
i
see
many
objections
to
any
such
theory
so
do
i
is
precisely
for
that
reason
that
we
are
going
to
this
day
i
want
to
see
whether
the
objections
are
fatal
or
if
they
may
be
explained
away
what
in
the
name
of
the
devil
ejaculation
had
been
drawn
from
my
companion
by
the
fact
that
our
door
had
been
suddenly
dashed
open
and
that
a
huge
man
had
framed
himself
in
the
aperture
costume
was
a
peculiar
mixture
of
the
professional
and
of
the
agricultural
having
a
black
top
hat
a
long
frock
coat
and
a
pair
of
high
gaiters
with
a
hunting
crop
swinging
in
his
hand
tall
was
he
that
his
hat
actually
brushed
the
cross
bar
of
the
doorway
and
his
breadth
seemed
to
span
it
across
from
side
to
side
a
large
face
seared
with
a
thousand
wrinkles
burned
yellow
with
the
sun
and
marked
with
every
evil
passion
was
turned
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
while
his
deep
set
bile
shot
eyes
and
his
high
thin
fleshless
nose
gave
him
somewhat
the
resemblance
to
a
fierce
old
bird
of
prey
of
you
is
asked
this
apparition
name
sir
but
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
said
my
companion
quietly
i
am
of
said
blandly
take
a
seat
i
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
stepdaughter
has
been
here
i
have
traced
her
has
she
been
saying
to
you
is
a
little
cold
for
the
time
of
the
year
said
has
she
been
saying
to
you
screamed
the
old
man
furiously
i
have
heard
that
the
crocuses
promise
well
continued
my
companion
imperturbably
put
me
off
do
you
said
our
new
visitor
taking
a
step
forward
and
shaking
his
hunting
crop
i
know
you
you
scoundrel
i
have
heard
of
you
before
are
the
meddler
friend
smiled
the
busybody
smile
broadened
the
in
office
chuckled
heartily
conversation
is
most
entertaining
said
he
you
go
out
close
the
door
for
there
is
a
decided
draught
i
will
go
when
i
have
said
my
say
t
you
dare
to
meddle
with
my
affairs
i
know
that
has
been
here
i
traced
her
i
am
a
dangerous
man
to
fall
foul
of
here
stepped
swiftly
forward
seized
the
poker
and
bent
it
into
a
curve
with
his
huge
brown
hands
that
you
keep
yourself
out
of
my
grip
he
snarled
and
hurling
the
twisted
poker
into
the
fireplace
he
strode
out
of
the
room
seems
a
very
amiable
person
said
laughing
i
am
not
quite
so
bulky
but
if
he
had
remained
i
might
have
shown
him
that
my
grip
was
not
much
more
feeble
than
his
own
he
spoke
he
picked
up
the
steel
poker
and
with
a
sudden
effort
straightened
it
out
again
his
having
the
insolence
to
confound
me
with
the
official
detective
force
incident
gives
zest
to
our
investigation
however
and
i
only
trust
that
our
little
friend
will
not
suffer
from
her
imprudence
in
allowing
this
brute
to
trace
her
now
we
shall
order
breakfast
and
afterwards
i
shall
walk
down
to
where
i
hope
to
get
some
data
which
may
help
us
in
this
matter
was
nearly
one
o
clock
when
returned
from
his
excursion
held
in
his
hand
a
sheet
of
blue
paper
scrawled
over
with
notes
and
figures
i
have
seen
the
will
of
the
deceased
wife
said
he
determine
its
exact
meaning
i
have
been
obliged
to
work
out
the
present
prices
of
the
investments
with
which
it
is
concerned
total
income
which
at
the
time
of
the
wife
s
death
was
little
short
of
pounds
is
now
through
the
fall
in
agricultural
prices
not
more
than
pounds
daughter
can
claim
an
income
of
pounds
in
case
of
marriage
is
evident
therefore
that
if
both
girls
had
married
this
beauty
would
have
had
a
mere
pittance
while
even
one
of
them
would
cripple
him
to
a
very
serious
extent
morning
s
work
has
not
been
wasted
since
it
has
proved
that
he
has
the
very
strongest
motives
for
standing
in
the
way
of
anything
of
the
sort
now
this
is
too
serious
for
dawdling
especially
as
the
old
man
is
aware
that
we
are
interesting
ourselves
in
his
affairs
so
if
you
are
ready
we
shall
call
a
cab
and
drive
to
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
would
slip
your
revolver
into
your
pocket
s
is
an
excellent
argument
with
gentlemen
who
can
twist
steel
pokers
into
knots
and
a
tooth
brush
are
i
think
all
that
we
need
we
were
fortunate
in
catching
a
train
for
where
we
hired
a
trap
at
the
station
inn
and
drove
for
four
or
five
miles
through
the
lovely
lanes
was
a
perfect
day
with
a
bright
sun
and
a
few
fleecy
clouds
in
the
heavens
trees
and
wayside
hedges
were
just
throwing
out
their
first
green
shoots
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
pleasant
smell
of
the
moist
earth
me
at
least
there
was
a
strange
contrast
between
the
sweet
promise
of
the
spring
and
this
sinister
quest
upon
which
we
were
engaged
companion
sat
in
the
front
of
the
trap
his
arms
folded
his
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
and
his
chin
sunk
upon
his
breast
buried
in
the
deepest
thought
however
he
started
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
and
pointed
over
the
meadows
there
said
he
a
heavily
timbered
park
stretched
up
in
a
gentle
slope
thickening
into
a
grove
at
the
highest
point
amid
the
branches
there
jutted
out
the
grey
gables
and
high
roof
tree
of
a
very
old
mansion
said
he
sir
that
be
the
house
of
remarked
the
driver
is
some
building
going
on
there
said
that
is
where
we
are
going
s
the
village
said
the
driver
pointing
to
a
cluster
of
roofs
some
distance
to
the
left
but
if
you
want
to
get
to
the
house
you
ll
find
it
shorter
to
get
over
this
stile
and
so
by
the
foot
path
over
the
fields
it
is
where
the
lady
is
walking
the
lady
i
fancy
is
observed
shading
his
eyes
i
think
we
had
better
do
as
you
suggest
got
off
paid
our
fare
and
the
trap
rattled
back
on
its
way
to
i
thought
it
as
well
said
as
we
climbed
the
stile
that
this
fellow
should
think
we
had
come
here
as
architects
or
on
some
definite
business
may
stop
his
gossip
afternoon
see
that
we
have
been
as
good
as
our
word
client
of
the
morning
had
hurried
forward
to
meet
us
with
a
face
which
spoke
her
joy
i
have
been
waiting
so
eagerly
for
you
she
cried
shaking
hands
with
us
warmly
has
turned
out
splendidly
has
gone
to
town
and
it
is
unlikely
that
he
will
be
back
before
evening
have
had
the
pleasure
of
making
the
doctor
s
acquaintance
said
and
in
a
few
words
he
sketched
out
what
had
occurred
turned
white
to
the
lips
as
she
listened
heavens
she
cried
he
has
followed
me
then
it
appears
is
so
cunning
that
i
never
know
when
i
am
safe
from
him
will
he
say
when
he
returns
must
guard
himself
for
he
may
find
that
there
is
someone
more
cunning
than
himself
upon
his
track
must
lock
yourself
up
from
him
to
night
he
is
violent
we
shall
take
you
away
to
your
aunt
s
at
we
must
make
the
best
use
of
our
time
so
kindly
take
us
at
once
to
the
rooms
which
we
are
to
examine
building
was
of
grey
lichen
blotched
stone
with
a
high
central
portion
and
two
curving
wings
like
the
claws
of
a
crab
thrown
out
on
each
side
one
of
these
wings
the
windows
were
broken
and
blocked
with
wooden
boards
while
the
roof
was
partly
caved
in
a
picture
of
ruin
central
portion
was
in
little
better
repair
but
the
right
hand
block
was
comparatively
modern
and
the
blinds
in
the
windows
with
the
blue
smoke
curling
up
from
the
chimneys
showed
that
this
was
where
the
family
resided
scaffolding
had
been
erected
against
the
end
wall
and
the
stone
work
had
been
broken
into
but
there
were
no
signs
of
any
workmen
at
the
moment
of
our
visit
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
ill
trimmed
lawn
and
examined
with
deep
attention
the
outsides
of
the
windows
i
take
it
belongs
to
the
room
in
which
you
used
to
sleep
the
centre
one
to
your
sister
s
and
the
one
next
to
the
main
building
to
s
chamber
so
i
am
now
sleeping
in
the
middle
one
the
alterations
as
i
understand
the
way
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
very
pressing
need
for
repairs
at
that
end
wall
were
none
i
believe
that
it
was
an
excuse
to
move
me
from
my
room
that
is
suggestive
on
the
other
side
of
this
narrow
wing
runs
the
corridor
from
which
these
three
rooms
open
are
windows
in
it
of
course
but
very
small
ones
narrow
for
anyone
to
pass
through
you
both
locked
your
doors
at
night
your
rooms
were
unapproachable
from
that
side
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
go
into
your
room
and
bar
your
shutters
did
so
and
after
a
careful
examination
through
the
open
window
endeavoured
in
every
way
to
force
the
shutter
open
but
without
success
was
no
slit
through
which
a
knife
could
be
passed
to
raise
the
bar
with
his
lens
he
tested
the
hinges
but
they
were
of
solid
iron
built
firmly
into
the
massive
masonry
said
he
scratching
his
chin
in
some
perplexity
my
theory
certainly
presents
some
difficulties
one
could
pass
these
shutters
if
they
were
bolted
we
shall
see
if
the
inside
throws
any
light
upon
the
matter
a
small
side
door
led
into
the
whitewashed
corridor
from
which
the
three
bedrooms
opened
refused
to
examine
the
third
chamber
so
we
passed
at
once
to
the
second
that
in
which
was
now
sleeping
and
in
which
her
sister
had
met
with
her
fate
was
a
homely
little
room
with
a
low
ceiling
and
a
gaping
fireplace
after
the
fashion
of
old
country
houses
a
brown
chest
of
drawers
stood
in
one
corner
a
narrow
white
counterpaned
bed
in
another
and
a
dressing
table
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
window
articles
with
two
small
wicker
work
chairs
made
up
all
the
furniture
in
the
room
save
for
a
square
of
carpet
in
the
centre
boards
round
and
the
panelling
of
the
walls
were
of
brown
worm
eaten
oak
so
old
and
discoloured
that
it
may
have
dated
from
the
original
building
of
the
house
drew
one
of
the
chairs
into
a
corner
and
sat
silent
while
his
eyes
travelled
round
and
round
and
up
and
down
taking
in
every
detail
of
the
apartment
does
that
bell
communicate
with
he
asked
at
last
pointing
to
a
thick
bell
rope
which
hung
down
beside
the
bed
the
tassel
actually
lying
upon
the
pillow
goes
to
the
housekeeper
s
room
looks
newer
than
the
other
things
it
was
only
put
there
a
couple
of
years
ago
sister
asked
for
it
i
suppose
i
never
heard
of
her
using
it
used
always
to
get
what
we
wanted
for
ourselves
it
seemed
unnecessary
to
put
so
nice
a
bell
pull
there
will
excuse
me
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
satisfy
myself
as
to
this
floor
threw
himself
down
upon
his
face
with
his
lens
in
his
hand
and
crawled
swiftly
backward
and
forward
examining
minutely
the
cracks
between
the
boards
he
did
the
same
with
the
wood
work
with
which
the
chamber
was
panelled
he
walked
over
to
the
bed
and
spent
some
time
in
staring
at
it
and
in
running
his
eye
up
and
down
the
wall
he
took
the
bell
rope
in
his
hand
and
gave
it
a
brisk
tug
it
s
a
dummy
said
he
t
it
ring
it
is
not
even
attached
to
a
wire
is
very
interesting
can
see
now
that
it
is
fastened
to
a
hook
just
above
where
the
little
opening
for
the
ventilator
is
very
absurd
i
never
noticed
that
before
strange
muttered
pulling
at
the
rope
are
one
or
two
very
singular
points
about
this
room
example
what
a
fool
a
builder
must
be
to
open
a
ventilator
into
another
room
when
with
the
same
trouble
he
might
have
communicated
with
the
outside
air
is
also
quite
modern
said
the
lady
about
the
same
time
as
the
bell
rope
remarked
there
were
several
little
changes
carried
out
about
that
time
seem
to
have
been
of
a
most
interesting
character
dummy
bell
ropes
and
ventilators
which
do
not
ventilate
your
permission
we
shall
now
carry
our
researches
into
the
inner
apartment
s
chamber
was
larger
than
that
of
his
step
daughter
but
was
as
plainly
furnished
a
camp
bed
a
small
wooden
shelf
full
of
books
mostly
of
a
technical
character
an
armchair
beside
the
bed
a
plain
wooden
chair
against
the
wall
a
round
table
and
a
large
iron
safe
were
the
principal
things
which
met
the
eye
walked
slowly
round
and
examined
each
and
all
of
them
with
the
keenest
interest
s
in
here
he
asked
tapping
the
safe
stepfather
s
business
papers
you
have
seen
inside
then
once
some
years
ago
i
remember
that
it
was
full
of
papers
isn
t
a
cat
in
it
for
example
a
strange
idea
look
at
this
took
up
a
small
saucer
of
milk
which
stood
on
the
top
of
it
we
don
t
keep
a
cat
there
is
a
cheetah
and
a
baboon
yes
of
course
a
cheetah
is
just
a
big
cat
and
yet
a
saucer
of
milk
does
not
go
very
far
in
satisfying
its
wants
i
daresay
is
one
point
which
i
should
wish
to
determine
squatted
down
in
front
of
the
wooden
chair
and
examined
the
seat
of
it
with
the
greatest
attention
you
is
quite
settled
said
he
rising
and
putting
his
lens
in
his
pocket
is
something
interesting
object
which
had
caught
his
eye
was
a
small
dog
lash
hung
on
one
corner
of
the
bed
lash
however
was
curled
upon
itself
and
tied
so
as
to
make
a
loop
of
whipcord
do
you
make
of
that
s
a
common
enough
lash
i
don
t
know
why
it
should
be
tied
is
not
quite
so
common
is
it
me
it
s
a
wicked
world
and
when
a
clever
man
turns
his
brains
to
crime
it
is
the
worst
of
all
i
think
that
i
have
seen
enough
now
and
with
your
permission
we
shall
walk
out
upon
the
lawn
i
had
never
seen
my
friend
s
face
so
grim
or
his
brow
so
dark
as
it
was
when
we
turned
from
the
scene
of
this
investigation
had
walked
several
times
up
and
down
the
lawn
neither
nor
myself
liking
to
break
in
upon
his
thoughts
before
he
roused
himself
from
his
reverie
is
very
essential
said
he
that
you
should
absolutely
follow
my
advice
in
every
respect
i
shall
most
certainly
do
so
matter
is
too
serious
for
any
hesitation
life
may
depend
upon
your
compliance
i
assure
you
that
i
am
in
your
hands
the
first
place
both
my
friend
and
i
must
spend
the
night
in
your
room
and
i
gazed
at
him
in
astonishment
it
must
be
so
me
explain
i
believe
that
that
is
the
village
inn
over
there
that
is
the
good
windows
would
be
visible
from
there
must
confine
yourself
to
your
room
on
pretence
of
a
headache
when
your
stepfather
comes
back
when
you
hear
him
retire
for
the
night
you
must
open
the
shutters
of
your
window
undo
the
hasp
put
your
lamp
there
as
a
signal
to
us
and
then
withdraw
quietly
with
everything
which
you
are
likely
to
want
into
the
room
which
you
used
to
occupy
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
spite
of
the
repairs
you
could
manage
there
for
one
night
yes
easily
rest
you
will
leave
in
our
hands
what
will
you
do
shall
spend
the
night
in
your
room
and
we
shall
investigate
the
cause
of
this
noise
which
has
disturbed
you
i
believe
that
you
have
already
made
up
your
mind
said
laying
her
hand
upon
my
companion
s
sleeve
i
have
for
pity
s
sake
tell
me
what
was
the
cause
of
my
sister
s
death
i
should
prefer
to
have
clearer
proofs
before
i
speak
can
at
least
tell
me
whether
my
own
thought
is
correct
and
if
she
died
from
some
sudden
fright
i
do
not
think
so
i
think
that
there
was
probably
some
more
tangible
cause
now
we
must
leave
you
for
if
returned
and
saw
us
our
journey
would
be
in
vain
bye
and
be
brave
for
if
you
will
do
what
i
have
told
you
you
may
rest
assured
that
we
shall
soon
drive
away
the
dangers
that
threaten
you
and
i
had
no
difficulty
in
engaging
a
bedroom
and
sitting
room
at
the
were
on
the
upper
floor
and
from
our
window
we
could
command
a
view
of
the
avenue
gate
and
of
the
inhabited
wing
of
dusk
we
saw
drive
past
his
huge
form
looming
up
beside
the
little
figure
of
the
lad
who
drove
him
boy
had
some
slight
difficulty
in
undoing
the
heavy
iron
gates
and
we
heard
the
hoarse
roar
of
the
doctor
s
voice
and
saw
the
fury
with
which
he
shook
his
clinched
fists
at
him
trap
drove
on
and
a
few
minutes
later
we
saw
a
sudden
light
spring
up
among
the
trees
as
the
lamp
was
lit
in
one
of
the
sitting
rooms
you
know
said
as
we
sat
together
in
the
gathering
darkness
i
have
really
some
scruples
as
to
taking
you
to
night
is
a
distinct
element
of
danger
i
be
of
assistance
presence
might
be
invaluable
i
shall
certainly
come
is
very
kind
of
you
speak
of
danger
have
evidently
seen
more
in
these
rooms
than
was
visible
to
me
but
i
fancy
that
i
may
have
deduced
a
little
more
i
imagine
that
you
saw
all
that
i
did
i
saw
nothing
remarkable
save
the
bell
rope
and
what
purpose
that
could
answer
i
confess
is
more
than
i
can
imagine
saw
the
ventilator
too
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
such
a
very
unusual
thing
to
have
a
small
opening
between
two
rooms
was
so
small
that
a
rat
could
hardly
pass
through
i
knew
that
we
should
find
a
ventilator
before
ever
we
came
to
dear
yes
i
did
remember
in
her
statement
she
said
that
her
sister
could
smell
s
cigar
of
course
that
suggested
at
once
that
there
must
be
a
communication
between
the
two
rooms
could
only
be
a
small
one
or
it
would
have
been
remarked
upon
at
the
coroner
s
inquiry
i
deduced
a
ventilator
what
harm
can
there
be
in
that
there
is
at
least
a
curious
coincidence
of
dates
a
ventilator
is
made
a
cord
is
hung
and
a
lady
who
sleeps
in
the
bed
dies
not
that
strike
you
i
cannot
as
yet
see
any
connection
you
observe
anything
very
peculiar
about
that
bed
was
clamped
to
the
floor
you
ever
see
a
bed
fastened
like
that
before
i
cannot
say
that
i
have
lady
could
not
move
her
bed
must
always
be
in
the
same
relative
position
to
the
ventilator
and
to
the
rope
or
so
we
may
call
it
since
it
was
clearly
never
meant
for
a
bell
pull
i
cried
i
seem
to
see
dimly
what
you
are
hinting
at
are
only
just
in
time
to
prevent
some
subtle
and
horrible
crime
enough
and
horrible
enough
a
doctor
does
go
wrong
he
is
the
first
of
criminals
has
nerve
and
he
has
knowledge
and
were
among
the
heads
of
their
profession
man
strikes
even
deeper
but
i
think
that
we
shall
be
able
to
strike
deeper
still
we
shall
have
horrors
enough
before
the
night
is
over
for
goodness
sake
let
us
have
a
quiet
pipe
and
turn
our
minds
for
a
few
hours
to
something
more
cheerful
nine
o
clock
the
light
among
the
trees
was
extinguished
and
all
was
dark
in
the
direction
of
the
hours
passed
slowly
away
and
then
suddenly
just
at
the
stroke
of
eleven
a
single
bright
light
shone
out
right
in
front
of
us
is
our
signal
said
springing
to
his
feet
it
comes
from
the
middle
window
we
passed
out
he
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
landlord
explaining
that
we
were
going
on
a
late
visit
to
an
acquaintance
and
that
it
was
possible
that
we
might
spend
the
night
there
a
moment
later
we
were
out
on
the
dark
road
a
chill
wind
blowing
in
our
faces
and
one
yellow
light
twinkling
in
front
of
us
through
the
gloom
to
guide
us
on
our
sombre
errand
was
little
difficulty
in
entering
the
grounds
for
unrepaired
breaches
gaped
in
the
old
park
wall
our
way
among
the
trees
we
reached
the
lawn
crossed
it
and
were
about
to
enter
through
the
window
when
out
from
a
clump
of
laurel
bushes
there
darted
what
seemed
to
be
a
hideous
and
distorted
child
who
threw
itself
upon
the
grass
with
writhing
limbs
and
then
ran
swiftly
across
the
lawn
into
the
darkness
i
whispered
did
you
see
it
was
for
the
moment
as
startled
as
i
hand
closed
like
a
vice
upon
my
wrist
in
his
agitation
he
broke
into
a
low
laugh
and
put
his
lips
to
my
ear
is
a
nice
household
he
murmured
is
the
baboon
i
had
forgotten
the
strange
pets
which
the
doctor
affected
was
a
cheetah
too
perhaps
we
might
find
it
upon
our
shoulders
at
any
moment
i
confess
that
i
felt
easier
in
my
mind
when
after
following
example
and
slipping
off
my
shoes
i
found
myself
inside
the
bedroom
companion
noiselessly
closed
the
shutters
moved
the
lamp
onto
the
table
and
cast
his
eyes
round
the
room
was
as
we
had
seen
it
in
the
daytime
creeping
up
to
me
and
making
a
trumpet
of
his
hand
he
whispered
into
my
ear
again
so
gently
that
it
was
all
that
i
could
do
to
distinguish
the
words
least
sound
would
be
fatal
to
our
plans
i
nodded
to
show
that
i
had
heard
must
sit
without
light
would
see
it
through
the
ventilator
i
nodded
again
not
go
asleep
your
very
life
may
depend
upon
it
your
pistol
ready
in
case
we
should
need
it
i
will
sit
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
you
in
that
chair
i
took
out
my
revolver
and
laid
it
on
the
corner
of
the
table
had
brought
up
a
long
thin
cane
and
this
he
placed
upon
the
bed
beside
him
it
he
laid
the
box
of
matches
and
the
stump
of
a
candle
he
turned
down
the
lamp
and
we
were
left
in
darkness
shall
i
ever
forget
that
dreadful
vigil
i
could
not
hear
a
sound
not
even
the
drawing
of
a
breath
and
yet
i
knew
that
my
companion
sat
open
eyed
within
a
few
feet
of
me
in
the
same
state
of
nervous
tension
in
which
i
was
myself
shutters
cut
off
the
least
ray
of
light
and
we
waited
in
absolute
darkness
outside
came
the
occasional
cry
of
a
night
bird
and
once
at
our
very
window
a
long
drawn
catlike
whine
which
told
us
that
the
cheetah
was
indeed
at
liberty
away
we
could
hear
the
deep
tones
of
the
parish
clock
which
boomed
out
every
quarter
of
an
hour
long
they
seemed
those
quarters
struck
and
one
and
two
and
three
and
still
we
sat
waiting
silently
for
whatever
might
befall
there
was
the
momentary
gleam
of
a
light
up
in
the
direction
of
the
ventilator
which
vanished
immediately
but
was
succeeded
by
a
strong
smell
of
burning
oil
and
heated
metal
in
the
next
room
had
lit
a
dark
lantern
i
heard
a
gentle
sound
of
movement
and
then
all
was
silent
once
more
though
the
smell
grew
stronger
half
an
hour
i
sat
with
straining
ears
suddenly
another
sound
became
audible
a
very
gentle
soothing
sound
like
that
of
a
small
jet
of
steam
escaping
continually
from
a
kettle
instant
that
we
heard
it
sprang
from
the
bed
struck
a
match
and
lashed
furiously
with
his
cane
at
the
bell
pull
see
it
he
yelled
see
it
i
saw
nothing
the
moment
when
struck
the
light
i
heard
a
low
clear
whistle
but
the
sudden
glare
flashing
into
my
weary
eyes
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
tell
what
it
was
at
which
my
friend
lashed
so
savagely
i
could
however
see
that
his
face
was
deadly
pale
and
filled
with
horror
and
loathing
had
ceased
to
strike
and
was
gazing
up
at
the
ventilator
when
suddenly
there
broke
from
the
silence
of
the
night
the
most
horrible
cry
to
which
i
have
ever
listened
swelled
up
louder
and
louder
a
hoarse
yell
of
pain
and
fear
and
anger
all
mingled
in
the
one
dreadful
shriek
say
that
away
down
in
the
village
and
even
in
the
distant
parsonage
that
cry
raised
the
sleepers
from
their
beds
struck
cold
to
our
hearts
and
i
stood
gazing
at
and
he
at
me
until
the
last
echoes
of
it
had
died
away
into
the
silence
from
which
it
rose
can
it
mean
i
gasped
means
that
it
is
all
over
answered
perhaps
after
all
it
is
for
the
best
your
pistol
and
we
will
enter
s
room
a
grave
face
he
lit
the
lamp
and
led
the
way
down
the
corridor
he
struck
at
the
chamber
door
without
any
reply
from
within
he
turned
the
handle
and
entered
i
at
his
heels
with
the
cocked
pistol
in
my
hand
was
a
singular
sight
which
met
our
eyes
the
table
stood
a
dark
lantern
with
the
shutter
half
open
throwing
a
brilliant
beam
of
light
upon
the
iron
safe
the
door
of
which
was
ajar
this
table
on
the
wooden
chair
sat
clad
in
a
long
grey
dressing
gown
his
bare
ankles
protruding
beneath
and
his
feet
thrust
into
red
heelless
slippers
his
lap
lay
the
short
stock
with
the
long
lash
which
we
had
noticed
during
the
day
chin
was
cocked
upward
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
in
a
dreadful
rigid
stare
at
the
corner
of
the
ceiling
his
brow
he
had
a
peculiar
yellow
band
with
brownish
speckles
which
seemed
to
be
bound
tightly
round
his
head
we
entered
he
made
neither
sound
nor
motion
band
the
speckled
band
whispered
i
took
a
step
forward
an
instant
his
strange
headgear
began
to
move
and
there
reared
itself
from
among
his
hair
the
squat
diamond
shaped
head
and
puffed
neck
of
a
loathsome
serpent
is
a
swamp
adder
cried
the
deadliest
snake
in
has
died
within
ten
seconds
of
being
bitten
does
in
truth
recoil
upon
the
violent
and
the
schemer
falls
into
the
pit
which
he
digs
for
another
us
thrust
this
creature
back
into
its
den
and
we
can
then
remove
to
some
place
of
shelter
and
let
the
county
police
know
what
has
happened
he
spoke
he
drew
the
dog
whip
swiftly
from
the
dead
man
s
lap
and
throwing
the
noose
round
the
reptile
s
neck
he
drew
it
from
its
horrid
perch
and
carrying
it
at
arm
s
length
threw
it
into
the
iron
safe
which
he
closed
upon
it
are
the
true
facts
of
the
death
of
of
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
prolong
a
narrative
which
has
already
run
to
too
great
a
length
by
telling
how
we
broke
the
sad
news
to
the
terrified
girl
how
we
conveyed
her
by
the
morning
train
to
the
care
of
her
good
aunt
at
of
how
the
slow
process
of
official
inquiry
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
doctor
met
his
fate
while
indiscreetly
playing
with
a
dangerous
pet
little
which
i
had
yet
to
learn
of
the
case
was
told
me
by
as
we
travelled
back
next
day
i
had
said
he
come
to
an
entirely
erroneous
conclusion
which
shows
my
dear
how
dangerous
it
always
is
to
reason
from
insufficient
data
presence
of
the
gipsies
and
the
use
of
the
word
band
which
was
used
by
the
poor
girl
no
doubt
to
explain
the
appearance
which
she
had
caught
a
hurried
glimpse
of
by
the
light
of
her
match
were
sufficient
to
put
me
upon
an
entirely
wrong
scent
i
can
only
claim
the
merit
that
i
instantly
reconsidered
my
position
when
however
it
became
clear
to
me
that
whatever
danger
threatened
an
occupant
of
the
room
could
not
come
either
from
the
window
or
the
door
attention
was
speedily
drawn
as
i
have
already
remarked
to
you
to
this
ventilator
and
to
the
bell
rope
which
hung
down
to
the
bed
discovery
that
this
was
a
dummy
and
that
the
bed
was
clamped
to
the
floor
instantly
gave
rise
to
the
suspicion
that
the
rope
was
there
as
a
bridge
for
something
passing
through
the
hole
and
coming
to
the
bed
idea
of
a
snake
instantly
occurred
to
me
and
when
i
coupled
it
with
my
knowledge
that
the
doctor
was
furnished
with
a
supply
of
creatures
from
i
felt
that
i
was
probably
on
the
right
track
idea
of
using
a
form
of
poison
which
could
not
possibly
be
discovered
by
any
chemical
test
was
just
such
a
one
as
would
occur
to
a
clever
and
ruthless
man
who
had
had
an
training
rapidity
with
which
such
a
poison
would
take
effect
would
also
from
his
point
of
view
be
an
advantage
would
be
a
sharp
eyed
coroner
indeed
who
could
distinguish
the
two
little
dark
punctures
which
would
show
where
the
poison
fangs
had
done
their
work
i
thought
of
the
whistle
course
he
must
recall
the
snake
before
the
morning
light
revealed
it
to
the
victim
had
trained
it
probably
by
the
use
of
the
milk
which
we
saw
to
return
to
him
when
summoned
would
put
it
through
this
ventilator
at
the
hour
that
he
thought
best
with
the
certainty
that
it
would
crawl
down
the
rope
and
land
on
the
bed
might
or
might
not
bite
the
occupant
perhaps
she
might
escape
every
night
for
a
week
but
sooner
or
later
she
must
fall
a
victim
i
had
come
to
these
conclusions
before
ever
i
had
entered
his
room
inspection
of
his
chair
showed
me
that
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
standing
on
it
which
of
course
would
be
necessary
in
order
that
he
should
reach
the
ventilator
sight
of
the
safe
the
saucer
of
milk
and
the
loop
of
whipcord
were
enough
to
finally
dispel
any
doubts
which
may
have
remained
metallic
clang
heard
by
was
obviously
caused
by
her
stepfather
hastily
closing
the
door
of
his
safe
upon
its
terrible
occupant
once
made
up
my
mind
you
know
the
steps
which
i
took
in
order
to
put
the
matter
to
the
proof
i
heard
the
creature
hiss
as
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
did
also
and
i
instantly
lit
the
light
and
attacked
it
the
result
of
driving
it
through
the
ventilator
also
with
the
result
of
causing
it
to
turn
upon
its
master
at
the
other
side
of
the
blows
of
my
cane
came
home
and
roused
its
snakish
temper
so
that
it
flew
upon
the
first
person
it
saw
this
way
i
am
no
doubt
indirectly
responsible
for
s
death
and
i
cannot
say
that
it
is
likely
to
weigh
very
heavily
upon
my
conscience
ix
the
adventure
of
the
engineer
s
thumb
all
the
problems
which
have
been
submitted
to
my
friend
for
solution
during
the
years
of
our
intimacy
there
were
only
two
which
i
was
the
means
of
introducing
to
his
notice
that
of
s
thumb
and
that
of
s
madness
these
the
latter
may
have
afforded
a
finer
field
for
an
acute
and
original
observer
but
the
other
was
so
strange
in
its
inception
and
so
dramatic
in
its
details
that
it
may
be
the
more
worthy
of
being
placed
upon
record
even
if
it
gave
my
friend
fewer
openings
for
those
deductive
methods
of
reasoning
by
which
he
achieved
such
remarkable
results
story
has
i
believe
been
told
more
than
once
in
the
newspapers
but
like
all
such
narratives
its
effect
is
much
less
striking
when
set
forth
en
bloc
in
a
single
half
column
of
print
than
when
the
facts
slowly
evolve
before
your
own
eyes
and
the
mystery
clears
gradually
away
as
each
new
discovery
furnishes
a
step
which
leads
on
to
the
complete
truth
the
time
the
circumstances
made
a
deep
impression
upon
me
and
the
lapse
of
two
years
has
hardly
served
to
weaken
the
effect
was
in
the
summer
of
not
long
after
my
marriage
that
the
events
occurred
which
i
am
now
about
to
summarise
i
had
returned
to
civil
practice
and
had
finally
abandoned
in
his
rooms
although
i
continually
visited
him
and
occasionally
even
persuaded
him
to
forgo
his
habits
so
far
as
to
come
and
visit
us
practice
had
steadily
increased
and
as
i
happened
to
live
at
no
very
great
distance
from
i
got
a
few
patients
from
among
the
officials
of
these
whom
i
had
cured
of
a
painful
and
lingering
disease
was
never
weary
of
advertising
my
virtues
and
of
endeavouring
to
send
me
on
every
sufferer
over
whom
he
might
have
any
influence
morning
at
a
little
before
seven
o
clock
i
was
awakened
by
the
maid
tapping
at
the
door
to
announce
that
two
men
had
come
from
and
were
waiting
in
the
consulting
room
i
dressed
hurriedly
for
i
knew
by
experience
that
railway
cases
were
seldom
trivial
and
hastened
downstairs
i
descended
my
old
ally
the
guard
came
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
tightly
behind
him
i
ve
got
him
here
he
whispered
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
he
s
all
right
is
it
then
i
asked
for
his
manner
suggested
that
it
was
some
strange
creature
which
he
had
caged
up
in
my
room
s
a
new
patient
he
whispered
i
thought
i
d
bring
him
round
myself
then
he
couldn
t
slip
away
he
is
all
safe
and
sound
i
must
go
now
i
have
my
dooties
just
the
same
as
you
off
he
went
this
trusty
tout
without
even
giving
me
time
to
thank
him
i
entered
my
consulting
room
and
found
a
gentleman
seated
by
the
table
was
quietly
dressed
in
a
suit
of
heather
tweed
with
a
soft
cloth
cap
which
he
had
laid
down
upon
my
books
one
of
his
hands
he
had
a
handkerchief
wrapped
which
was
mottled
all
over
with
bloodstains
was
young
not
more
than
five
and
twenty
i
should
say
with
a
strong
masculine
face
but
he
was
exceedingly
pale
and
gave
me
the
impression
of
a
man
who
was
suffering
from
some
strong
agitation
which
it
took
all
his
strength
of
mind
to
control
i
am
sorry
to
knock
you
up
so
early
said
he
but
i
have
had
a
very
serious
accident
during
the
night
i
came
in
by
train
this
morning
and
on
inquiring
at
as
to
where
i
might
find
a
doctor
a
worthy
fellow
very
kindly
escorted
me
here
i
gave
the
maid
a
card
but
i
see
that
she
has
left
it
upon
the
side
table
i
took
it
up
and
glanced
at
it
hydraulic
engineer
a
rd
floor
was
the
name
style
and
abode
of
my
morning
visitor
i
regret
that
i
have
kept
you
waiting
said
i
sitting
down
in
my
library
chair
are
fresh
from
a
night
journey
i
understand
which
is
in
itself
a
monotonous
occupation
my
night
could
not
be
called
monotonous
said
he
and
laughed
laughed
very
heartily
with
a
high
ringing
note
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
shaking
his
sides
my
medical
instincts
rose
up
against
that
laugh
it
i
cried
pull
yourself
together
and
i
poured
out
some
water
from
a
caraffe
was
useless
however
was
off
in
one
of
those
hysterical
outbursts
which
come
upon
a
strong
nature
when
some
great
crisis
is
over
and
gone
he
came
to
himself
once
more
very
weary
and
pale
looking
i
have
been
making
a
fool
of
myself
he
gasped
at
all
this
i
dashed
some
brandy
into
the
water
and
the
colour
began
to
come
back
to
his
bloodless
cheeks
s
better
said
he
now
perhaps
you
would
kindly
attend
to
my
thumb
or
rather
to
the
place
where
my
thumb
used
to
be
unwound
the
handkerchief
and
held
out
his
hand
gave
even
my
hardened
nerves
a
shudder
to
look
at
it
were
four
protruding
fingers
and
a
horrid
red
spongy
surface
where
the
thumb
should
have
been
had
been
hacked
or
torn
right
out
from
the
roots
heavens
i
cried
this
is
a
terrible
injury
must
have
bled
considerably
it
did
i
fainted
when
it
was
done
and
i
think
that
i
must
have
been
senseless
for
a
long
time
i
came
to
i
found
that
it
was
still
bleeding
so
i
tied
one
end
of
my
handkerchief
very
tightly
round
the
wrist
and
braced
it
up
with
a
twig
should
have
been
a
surgeon
is
a
question
of
hydraulics
you
see
and
came
within
my
own
province
has
been
done
said
i
examining
the
wound
by
a
very
heavy
and
sharp
instrument
a
thing
like
a
cleaver
said
he
accident
i
presume
no
means
a
murderous
attack
murderous
indeed
horrify
me
i
sponged
the
wound
cleaned
it
dressed
it
and
finally
covered
it
over
with
cotton
wadding
and
carbolised
bandages
lay
back
without
wincing
though
he
bit
his
lip
from
time
to
time
is
that
i
asked
when
i
had
finished
your
brandy
and
your
bandage
i
feel
a
new
man
i
was
very
weak
but
i
have
had
a
good
deal
to
go
through
you
had
better
not
speak
of
the
matter
is
evidently
trying
to
your
nerves
no
not
now
i
shall
have
to
tell
my
tale
to
the
police
but
between
ourselves
if
it
were
not
for
the
convincing
evidence
of
this
wound
of
mine
i
should
be
surprised
if
they
believed
my
statement
for
it
is
a
very
extraordinary
one
and
i
have
not
much
in
the
way
of
proof
with
which
to
back
it
up
and
even
if
they
believe
me
the
clues
which
i
can
give
them
are
so
vague
that
it
is
a
question
whether
justice
will
be
done
cried
i
if
it
is
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
problem
which
you
desire
to
see
solved
i
should
strongly
recommend
you
to
come
to
my
friend
before
you
go
to
the
official
police
i
have
heard
of
that
fellow
answered
my
visitor
and
i
should
be
very
glad
if
he
would
take
the
matter
up
though
of
course
i
must
use
the
official
police
as
well
you
give
me
an
introduction
to
him
i
ll
do
better
i
ll
take
you
round
to
him
myself
i
should
be
immensely
obliged
to
you
ll
call
a
cab
and
go
together
shall
just
be
in
time
to
have
a
little
breakfast
with
him
you
feel
equal
to
it
i
shall
not
feel
easy
until
i
have
told
my
story
my
servant
will
call
a
cab
and
i
shall
be
with
you
in
an
instant
i
rushed
upstairs
explained
the
matter
shortly
to
my
wife
and
in
five
minutes
was
inside
a
hansom
driving
with
my
new
acquaintance
to
was
as
i
expected
lounging
about
his
sitting
room
in
his
dressing
gown
reading
the
agony
column
of
and
smoking
his
before
breakfast
pipe
which
was
composed
of
all
the
plugs
and
dottles
left
from
his
smokes
of
the
day
before
all
carefully
dried
and
collected
on
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
received
us
in
his
quietly
genial
fashion
ordered
fresh
rashers
and
eggs
and
joined
us
in
a
hearty
meal
it
was
concluded
he
settled
our
new
acquaintance
upon
the
sofa
placed
a
pillow
beneath
his
head
and
laid
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
within
his
reach
is
easy
to
see
that
your
experience
has
been
no
common
one
said
he
lie
down
there
and
make
yourself
absolutely
at
home
us
what
you
can
but
stop
when
you
are
tired
and
keep
up
your
strength
with
a
little
stimulant
you
said
my
patient
but
i
have
felt
another
man
since
the
doctor
bandaged
me
and
i
think
that
your
breakfast
has
completed
the
cure
i
shall
take
up
as
little
of
your
valuable
time
as
possible
so
i
shall
start
at
once
upon
my
peculiar
experiences
sat
in
his
big
armchair
with
the
weary
heavy
lidded
expression
which
veiled
his
keen
and
eager
nature
while
i
sat
opposite
to
him
and
we
listened
in
silence
to
the
strange
story
which
our
visitor
detailed
to
us
must
know
said
he
that
i
am
an
orphan
and
a
bachelor
residing
alone
in
lodgings
in
profession
i
am
a
hydraulic
engineer
and
i
have
had
considerable
experience
of
my
work
during
the
seven
years
that
i
was
apprenticed
to
the
well
known
firm
of
years
ago
having
served
my
time
and
having
also
come
into
a
fair
sum
of
money
through
my
poor
father
s
death
i
determined
to
start
in
business
for
myself
and
took
professional
chambers
in
i
suppose
that
everyone
finds
his
first
independent
start
in
business
a
dreary
experience
me
it
has
been
exceptionally
so
two
years
i
have
had
three
consultations
and
one
small
job
and
that
is
absolutely
all
that
my
profession
has
brought
me
gross
takings
amount
to
pounds
s
day
from
nine
in
the
morning
until
four
in
the
afternoon
i
waited
in
my
little
den
until
at
last
my
heart
began
to
sink
and
i
came
to
believe
that
i
should
never
have
any
practice
at
all
however
just
as
i
was
thinking
of
leaving
the
office
my
clerk
entered
to
say
there
was
a
gentleman
waiting
who
wished
to
see
me
upon
business
brought
up
a
card
too
with
the
name
of
engraved
upon
it
at
his
heels
came
the
colonel
himself
a
man
rather
over
the
middle
size
but
of
an
exceeding
thinness
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
ever
seen
so
thin
a
man
whole
face
sharpened
away
into
nose
and
chin
and
the
skin
of
his
cheeks
was
drawn
quite
tense
over
his
outstanding
bones
this
emaciation
seemed
to
be
his
natural
habit
and
due
to
no
disease
for
his
eye
was
bright
his
step
brisk
and
his
bearing
assured
was
plainly
but
neatly
dressed
and
his
age
i
should
judge
would
be
nearer
forty
than
thirty
said
he
with
something
of
a
accent
have
been
recommended
to
me
as
being
a
man
who
is
not
only
proficient
in
his
profession
but
is
also
discreet
and
capable
of
preserving
a
secret
i
bowed
feeling
as
flattered
as
any
young
man
would
at
such
an
address
i
ask
who
it
was
who
gave
me
so
good
a
character
perhaps
it
is
better
that
i
should
not
tell
you
that
just
at
this
moment
i
have
it
from
the
same
source
that
you
are
both
an
orphan
and
a
bachelor
and
are
residing
alone
in
is
quite
correct
i
answered
but
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
say
that
i
cannot
see
how
all
this
bears
upon
my
professional
qualifications
i
understand
that
it
was
on
a
professional
matter
that
you
wished
to
speak
to
me
so
you
will
find
that
all
i
say
is
really
to
the
point
i
have
a
professional
commission
for
you
but
absolute
secrecy
is
quite
essential
absolute
secrecy
you
understand
and
of
course
we
may
expect
that
more
from
a
man
who
is
alone
than
from
one
who
lives
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
i
promise
to
keep
a
secret
said
i
you
may
absolutely
depend
upon
my
doing
so
looked
very
hard
at
me
as
i
spoke
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
never
seen
so
suspicious
and
questioning
an
eye
you
promise
then
said
he
at
last
i
promise
and
complete
silence
before
during
and
after
reference
to
the
matter
at
all
either
in
word
or
writing
i
have
already
given
you
my
word
good
suddenly
sprang
up
and
darting
like
lightning
across
the
room
he
flung
open
the
door
passage
outside
was
empty
s
all
right
said
he
coming
back
i
know
that
clerks
are
sometimes
curious
as
to
their
master
s
affairs
we
can
talk
in
safety
drew
up
his
chair
very
close
to
mine
and
began
to
stare
at
me
again
with
the
same
questioning
and
thoughtful
look
a
feeling
of
repulsion
and
of
something
akin
to
fear
had
begun
to
rise
within
me
at
the
strange
antics
of
this
fleshless
man
my
dread
of
losing
a
client
could
not
restrain
me
from
showing
my
impatience
i
beg
that
you
will
state
your
business
sir
said
i
my
time
is
of
value
forgive
me
for
that
last
sentence
but
the
words
came
to
my
lips
would
fifty
guineas
for
a
night
s
work
suit
you
he
asked
admirably
i
say
a
night
s
work
but
an
hour
s
would
be
nearer
the
mark
i
simply
want
your
opinion
about
a
hydraulic
stamping
machine
which
has
got
out
of
gear
you
show
us
what
is
wrong
we
shall
soon
set
it
right
ourselves
do
you
think
of
such
a
commission
as
that
work
appears
to
be
light
and
the
pay
munificent
so
shall
want
you
to
come
to
night
by
the
last
train
to
in
is
a
little
place
near
the
borders
of
and
within
seven
miles
of
is
a
train
from
which
would
bring
you
there
at
about
good
i
shall
come
down
in
a
carriage
to
meet
you
is
a
drive
then
our
little
place
is
quite
out
in
the
country
is
a
good
seven
miles
from
we
can
hardly
get
there
before
midnight
i
suppose
there
would
be
no
chance
of
a
train
back
i
should
be
compelled
to
stop
the
night
we
could
easily
give
you
a
shake
down
is
very
awkward
i
not
come
at
some
more
convenient
hour
have
judged
it
best
that
you
should
come
late
is
to
recompense
you
for
any
inconvenience
that
we
are
paying
to
you
a
young
and
unknown
man
a
fee
which
would
buy
an
opinion
from
the
very
heads
of
your
profession
of
course
if
you
would
like
to
draw
out
of
the
business
there
is
plenty
of
time
to
do
so
i
thought
of
the
fifty
guineas
and
of
how
very
useful
they
would
be
to
me
at
all
said
i
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
accommodate
myself
to
your
wishes
i
should
like
however
to
understand
a
little
more
clearly
what
it
is
that
you
wish
me
to
do
so
is
very
natural
that
the
pledge
of
secrecy
which
we
have
exacted
from
you
should
have
aroused
your
curiosity
i
have
no
wish
to
commit
you
to
anything
without
your
having
it
all
laid
before
you
i
suppose
that
we
are
absolutely
safe
from
eavesdroppers
the
matter
stands
thus
are
probably
aware
that
fuller
s
earth
is
a
valuable
product
and
that
it
is
only
found
in
one
or
two
places
in
i
have
heard
so
little
time
ago
i
bought
a
small
place
a
very
small
place
within
ten
miles
of
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
discover
that
there
was
a
deposit
of
fuller
s
earth
in
one
of
my
fields
examining
it
however
i
found
that
this
deposit
was
a
comparatively
small
one
and
that
it
formed
a
link
between
two
very
much
larger
ones
upon
the
right
and
left
both
of
them
however
in
the
grounds
of
my
neighbours
good
people
were
absolutely
ignorant
that
their
land
contained
that
which
was
quite
as
valuable
as
a
gold
mine
it
was
to
my
interest
to
buy
their
land
before
they
discovered
its
true
value
but
unfortunately
i
had
no
capital
by
which
i
could
do
this
i
took
a
few
of
my
friends
into
the
secret
however
and
they
suggested
that
we
should
quietly
and
secretly
work
our
own
little
deposit
and
that
in
this
way
we
should
earn
the
money
which
would
enable
us
to
buy
the
neighbouring
fields
we
have
now
been
doing
for
some
time
and
in
order
to
help
us
in
our
operations
we
erected
a
hydraulic
press
press
as
i
have
already
explained
has
got
out
of
order
and
we
wish
your
advice
upon
the
subject
guard
our
secret
very
jealously
however
and
if
it
once
became
known
that
we
had
hydraulic
engineers
coming
to
our
little
house
it
would
soon
rouse
inquiry
and
then
if
the
facts
came
out
it
would
be
good
bye
to
any
chance
of
getting
these
fields
and
carrying
out
our
plans
is
why
i
have
made
you
promise
me
that
you
will
not
tell
a
human
being
that
you
are
going
to
to
night
i
hope
that
i
make
it
all
plain
i
quite
follow
you
said
i
only
point
which
i
could
not
quite
understand
was
what
use
you
could
make
of
a
hydraulic
press
in
excavating
fuller
s
earth
which
as
i
understand
is
dug
out
like
gravel
from
a
pit
said
he
carelessly
we
have
our
own
process
compress
the
earth
into
bricks
so
as
to
remove
them
without
revealing
what
they
are
that
is
a
mere
detail
i
have
taken
you
fully
into
my
confidence
now
and
i
have
shown
you
how
i
trust
you
rose
as
he
spoke
i
shall
expect
you
then
at
at
i
shall
certainly
be
there
not
a
word
to
a
soul
looked
at
me
with
a
last
long
questioning
gaze
and
then
pressing
my
hand
in
a
cold
dank
grasp
he
hurried
from
the
room
when
i
came
to
think
it
all
over
in
cool
blood
i
was
very
much
astonished
as
you
may
both
think
at
this
sudden
commission
which
had
been
intrusted
to
me
the
one
hand
of
course
i
was
glad
for
the
fee
was
at
least
tenfold
what
i
should
have
asked
had
i
set
a
price
upon
my
own
services
and
it
was
possible
that
this
order
might
lead
to
other
ones
the
other
hand
the
face
and
manner
of
my
patron
had
made
an
unpleasant
impression
upon
me
and
i
could
not
think
that
his
explanation
of
the
fuller
s
earth
was
sufficient
to
explain
the
necessity
for
my
coming
at
midnight
and
his
extreme
anxiety
lest
i
should
tell
anyone
of
my
errand
i
threw
all
fears
to
the
winds
ate
a
hearty
supper
drove
to
and
started
off
having
obeyed
to
the
letter
the
injunction
as
to
holding
my
tongue
i
had
to
change
not
only
my
carriage
but
my
station
i
was
in
time
for
the
last
train
to
and
i
reached
the
little
dim
lit
station
after
eleven
o
clock
i
was
the
only
passenger
who
got
out
there
and
there
was
no
one
upon
the
platform
save
a
single
sleepy
porter
with
a
lantern
i
passed
out
through
the
wicket
gate
however
i
found
my
acquaintance
of
the
morning
waiting
in
the
shadow
upon
the
other
side
a
word
he
grasped
my
arm
and
hurried
me
into
a
carriage
the
door
of
which
was
standing
open
drew
up
the
windows
on
either
side
tapped
on
the
wood
work
and
away
we
went
as
fast
as
the
horse
could
go
horse
interjected
only
one
you
observe
the
colour
i
saw
it
by
the
side
lights
when
i
was
stepping
into
the
carriage
was
a
chestnut
looking
or
fresh
fresh
and
glossy
you
i
am
sorry
to
have
interrupted
you
continue
your
most
interesting
statement
we
went
then
and
we
drove
for
at
least
an
hour
had
said
that
it
was
only
seven
miles
but
i
should
think
from
the
rate
that
we
seemed
to
go
and
from
the
time
that
we
took
that
it
must
have
been
nearer
twelve
sat
at
my
side
in
silence
all
the
time
and
i
was
aware
more
than
once
when
i
glanced
in
his
direction
that
he
was
looking
at
me
with
great
intensity
country
roads
seem
to
be
not
very
good
in
that
part
of
the
world
for
we
lurched
and
jolted
terribly
i
tried
to
look
out
of
the
windows
to
see
something
of
where
we
were
but
they
were
made
of
frosted
glass
and
i
could
make
out
nothing
save
the
occasional
bright
blur
of
a
passing
light
and
then
i
hazarded
some
remark
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
journey
but
the
colonel
answered
only
in
monosyllables
and
the
conversation
soon
flagged
last
however
the
bumping
of
the
road
was
exchanged
for
the
crisp
smoothness
of
a
gravel
drive
and
the
carriage
came
to
a
stand
sprang
out
and
as
i
followed
after
him
pulled
me
swiftly
into
a
porch
which
gaped
in
front
of
us
stepped
as
it
were
right
out
of
the
carriage
and
into
the
hall
so
that
i
failed
to
catch
the
most
fleeting
glance
of
the
front
of
the
house
instant
that
i
had
crossed
the
threshold
the
door
slammed
heavily
behind
us
and
i
heard
faintly
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
as
the
carriage
drove
away
was
pitch
dark
inside
the
house
and
the
colonel
fumbled
about
looking
for
matches
and
muttering
under
his
breath
a
door
opened
at
the
other
end
of
the
passage
and
a
long
golden
bar
of
light
shot
out
in
our
direction
grew
broader
and
a
woman
appeared
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
which
she
held
above
her
head
pushing
her
face
forward
and
peering
at
us
i
could
see
that
she
was
pretty
and
from
the
gloss
with
which
the
light
shone
upon
her
dark
dress
i
knew
that
it
was
a
rich
material
spoke
a
few
words
in
a
foreign
tongue
in
a
tone
as
though
asking
a
question
and
when
my
companion
answered
in
a
gruff
monosyllable
she
gave
such
a
start
that
the
lamp
nearly
fell
from
her
hand
went
up
to
her
whispered
something
in
her
ear
and
then
pushing
her
back
into
the
room
from
whence
she
had
come
he
walked
towards
me
again
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
wait
in
this
room
for
a
few
minutes
said
he
throwing
open
another
door
was
a
quiet
little
plainly
furnished
room
with
a
round
table
in
the
centre
on
which
several
books
were
scattered
laid
down
the
lamp
on
the
top
of
a
harmonium
beside
the
door
i
shall
not
keep
you
waiting
an
instant
said
he
and
vanished
into
the
darkness
i
glanced
at
the
books
upon
the
table
and
in
spite
of
my
ignorance
of
i
could
see
that
two
of
them
were
treatises
on
science
the
others
being
volumes
of
poetry
i
walked
across
to
the
window
hoping
that
i
might
catch
some
glimpse
of
the
country
side
but
an
oak
shutter
heavily
barred
was
folded
across
it
was
a
wonderfully
silent
house
was
an
old
clock
ticking
loudly
somewhere
in
the
passage
but
otherwise
everything
was
deadly
still
a
vague
feeling
of
uneasiness
began
to
steal
over
me
were
these
people
and
what
were
they
doing
living
in
this
strange
out
of
the
way
place
where
was
the
place
i
was
ten
miles
or
so
from
that
was
all
i
knew
but
whether
north
south
east
or
west
i
had
no
idea
that
matter
and
possibly
other
large
towns
were
within
that
radius
so
the
place
might
not
be
so
secluded
after
all
it
was
quite
certain
from
the
absolute
stillness
that
we
were
in
the
country
i
paced
up
and
down
the
room
humming
a
tune
under
my
breath
to
keep
up
my
spirits
and
feeling
that
i
was
thoroughly
earning
my
fifty
guinea
fee
without
any
preliminary
sound
in
the
midst
of
the
utter
stillness
the
door
of
my
room
swung
slowly
open
woman
was
standing
in
the
aperture
the
darkness
of
the
hall
behind
her
the
yellow
light
from
my
lamp
beating
upon
her
eager
and
beautiful
face
i
could
see
at
a
glance
that
she
was
sick
with
fear
and
the
sight
sent
a
chill
to
my
own
heart
held
up
one
shaking
finger
to
warn
me
to
be
silent
and
she
shot
a
few
whispered
words
of
broken
at
me
her
eyes
glancing
back
like
those
of
a
frightened
horse
into
the
gloom
behind
her
i
would
go
said
she
trying
hard
as
it
seemed
to
me
to
speak
calmly
i
would
go
i
should
not
stay
here
is
no
good
for
you
to
do
madam
said
i
i
have
not
yet
done
what
i
came
for
i
cannot
possibly
leave
until
i
have
seen
the
machine
is
not
worth
your
while
to
wait
she
went
on
can
pass
through
the
door
no
one
hinders
then
seeing
that
i
smiled
and
shook
my
head
she
suddenly
threw
aside
her
constraint
and
made
a
step
forward
with
her
hands
wrung
together
the
love
of
she
whispered
get
away
from
here
before
it
is
too
late
i
am
somewhat
headstrong
by
nature
and
the
more
ready
to
engage
in
an
affair
when
there
is
some
obstacle
in
the
way
i
thought
of
my
fifty
guinea
fee
of
my
wearisome
journey
and
of
the
unpleasant
night
which
seemed
to
be
before
me
it
all
to
go
for
nothing
should
i
slink
away
without
having
carried
out
my
commission
and
without
the
payment
which
was
my
due
woman
might
for
all
i
knew
be
a
monomaniac
a
stout
bearing
therefore
though
her
manner
had
shaken
me
more
than
i
cared
to
confess
i
still
shook
my
head
and
declared
my
intention
of
remaining
where
i
was
was
about
to
renew
her
entreaties
when
a
door
slammed
overhead
and
the
sound
of
several
footsteps
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
listened
for
an
instant
threw
up
her
hands
with
a
despairing
gesture
and
vanished
as
suddenly
and
as
noiselessly
as
she
had
come
newcomers
were
and
a
short
thick
man
with
a
chinchilla
beard
growing
out
of
the
creases
of
his
double
chin
who
was
introduced
to
me
as
is
my
secretary
and
manager
said
the
colonel
the
way
i
was
under
the
impression
that
i
left
this
door
shut
just
now
i
fear
that
you
have
felt
the
draught
the
contrary
said
i
i
opened
the
door
myself
because
i
felt
the
room
to
be
a
little
close
shot
one
of
his
suspicious
looks
at
me
we
had
better
proceed
to
business
then
said
he
and
i
will
take
you
up
to
see
the
machine
i
had
better
put
my
hat
on
i
suppose
no
it
is
in
the
house
you
dig
fuller
s
earth
in
the
house
no
is
only
where
we
compress
it
never
mind
that
we
wish
you
to
do
is
to
examine
the
machine
and
to
let
us
know
what
is
wrong
with
it
went
upstairs
together
the
colonel
first
with
the
lamp
the
fat
manager
and
i
behind
him
was
a
labyrinth
of
an
old
house
with
corridors
passages
narrow
winding
staircases
and
little
low
doors
the
thresholds
of
which
were
hollowed
out
by
the
generations
who
had
crossed
them
were
no
carpets
and
no
signs
of
any
furniture
above
the
ground
floor
while
the
plaster
was
peeling
off
the
walls
and
the
damp
was
breaking
through
in
green
unhealthy
blotches
i
tried
to
put
on
as
unconcerned
an
air
as
possible
but
i
had
not
forgotten
the
warnings
of
the
lady
even
though
i
disregarded
them
and
i
kept
a
keen
eye
upon
my
two
companions
appeared
to
be
a
morose
and
silent
man
but
i
could
see
from
the
little
that
he
said
that
he
was
at
least
a
fellow
countryman
stopped
at
last
before
a
low
door
which
he
unlocked
was
a
small
square
room
in
which
the
three
of
us
could
hardly
get
at
one
time
remained
outside
and
the
colonel
ushered
me
in
are
now
said
he
actually
within
the
hydraulic
press
and
it
would
be
a
particularly
unpleasant
thing
for
us
if
anyone
were
to
turn
it
on
ceiling
of
this
small
chamber
is
really
the
end
of
the
descending
piston
and
it
comes
down
with
the
force
of
many
tons
upon
this
metal
floor
are
small
lateral
columns
of
water
outside
which
receive
the
force
and
which
transmit
and
multiply
it
in
the
manner
which
is
familiar
to
you
machine
goes
readily
enough
but
there
is
some
stiffness
in
the
working
of
it
and
it
has
lost
a
little
of
its
force
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
look
it
over
and
to
show
us
how
we
can
set
it
right
i
took
the
lamp
from
him
and
i
examined
the
machine
very
thoroughly
was
indeed
a
gigantic
one
and
capable
of
exercising
enormous
pressure
i
passed
outside
however
and
pressed
down
the
levers
which
controlled
it
i
knew
at
once
by
the
whishing
sound
that
there
was
a
slight
leakage
which
allowed
a
regurgitation
of
water
through
one
of
the
side
cylinders
examination
showed
that
one
of
the
india
rubber
bands
which
was
round
the
head
of
a
driving
rod
had
shrunk
so
as
not
quite
to
fill
the
socket
along
which
it
worked
was
clearly
the
cause
of
the
loss
of
power
and
i
pointed
it
out
to
my
companions
who
followed
my
remarks
very
carefully
and
asked
several
practical
questions
as
to
how
they
should
proceed
to
set
it
right
i
had
made
it
clear
to
them
i
returned
to
the
main
chamber
of
the
machine
and
took
a
good
look
at
it
to
satisfy
my
own
curiosity
was
obvious
at
a
glance
that
the
story
of
the
fuller
s
earth
was
the
merest
fabrication
for
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
so
powerful
an
engine
could
be
designed
for
so
inadequate
a
purpose
walls
were
of
wood
but
the
floor
consisted
of
a
large
iron
trough
and
when
i
came
to
examine
it
i
could
see
a
crust
of
metallic
deposit
all
over
it
i
had
stooped
and
was
scraping
at
this
to
see
exactly
what
it
was
when
i
heard
a
muttered
exclamation
in
and
saw
the
cadaverous
face
of
the
colonel
looking
down
at
me
are
you
doing
there
he
asked
i
felt
angry
at
having
been
tricked
by
so
elaborate
a
story
as
that
which
he
had
told
me
i
was
admiring
your
fuller
s
earth
said
i
i
think
that
i
should
be
better
able
to
advise
you
as
to
your
machine
if
i
knew
what
the
exact
purpose
was
for
which
it
was
used
instant
that
i
uttered
the
words
i
regretted
the
rashness
of
my
speech
face
set
hard
and
a
baleful
light
sprang
up
in
his
grey
eyes
well
said
he
you
shall
know
all
about
the
machine
took
a
step
backward
slammed
the
little
door
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
i
rushed
towards
it
and
pulled
at
the
handle
but
it
was
quite
secure
and
did
not
give
in
the
least
to
my
kicks
and
shoves
i
yelled
me
out
then
suddenly
in
the
silence
i
heard
a
sound
which
sent
my
heart
into
my
mouth
was
the
clank
of
the
levers
and
the
swish
of
the
leaking
cylinder
had
set
the
engine
at
work
lamp
still
stood
upon
the
floor
where
i
had
placed
it
when
examining
the
trough
its
light
i
saw
that
the
black
ceiling
was
coming
down
upon
me
slowly
jerkily
but
as
none
knew
better
than
myself
with
a
force
which
must
within
a
minute
grind
me
to
a
shapeless
pulp
i
threw
myself
screaming
against
the
door
and
dragged
with
my
nails
at
the
lock
i
implored
the
colonel
to
let
me
out
but
the
remorseless
clanking
of
the
levers
drowned
my
cries
ceiling
was
only
a
foot
or
two
above
my
head
and
with
my
hand
upraised
i
could
feel
its
hard
rough
surface
it
flashed
through
my
mind
that
the
pain
of
my
death
would
depend
very
much
upon
the
position
in
which
i
met
it
i
lay
on
my
face
the
weight
would
come
upon
my
spine
and
i
shuddered
to
think
of
that
dreadful
snap
the
other
way
perhaps
and
yet
had
i
the
nerve
to
lie
and
look
up
at
that
deadly
black
shadow
wavering
down
upon
me
i
was
unable
to
stand
erect
when
my
eye
caught
something
which
brought
a
gush
of
hope
back
to
my
heart
i
have
said
that
though
the
floor
and
ceiling
were
of
iron
the
walls
were
of
wood
i
gave
a
last
hurried
glance
around
i
saw
a
thin
line
of
yellow
light
between
two
of
the
boards
which
broadened
and
broadened
as
a
small
panel
was
pushed
backward
an
instant
i
could
hardly
believe
that
here
was
indeed
a
door
which
led
away
from
death
next
instant
i
threw
myself
through
and
lay
half
fainting
upon
the
other
side
panel
had
closed
again
behind
me
but
the
crash
of
the
lamp
and
a
few
moments
afterwards
the
clang
of
the
two
slabs
of
metal
told
me
how
narrow
had
been
my
escape
i
was
recalled
to
myself
by
a
frantic
plucking
at
my
wrist
and
i
found
myself
lying
upon
the
stone
floor
of
a
narrow
corridor
while
a
woman
bent
over
me
and
tugged
at
me
with
her
left
hand
while
she
held
a
candle
in
her
right
was
the
same
good
friend
whose
warning
i
had
so
foolishly
rejected
come
she
cried
breathlessly
will
be
here
in
a
moment
will
see
that
you
are
not
there
do
not
waste
the
so
precious
time
but
come
time
at
least
i
did
not
scorn
her
advice
i
staggered
to
my
feet
and
ran
with
her
along
the
corridor
and
down
a
winding
stair
latter
led
to
another
broad
passage
and
just
as
we
reached
it
we
heard
the
sound
of
running
feet
and
the
shouting
of
two
voices
one
answering
the
other
from
the
floor
on
which
we
were
and
from
the
one
beneath
guide
stopped
and
looked
about
her
like
one
who
is
at
her
wit
s
end
she
threw
open
a
door
which
led
into
a
bedroom
through
the
window
of
which
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
is
your
only
chance
said
she
is
high
but
it
may
be
that
you
can
jump
it
she
spoke
a
light
sprang
into
view
at
the
further
end
of
the
passage
and
i
saw
the
lean
figure
of
rushing
forward
with
a
lantern
in
one
hand
and
a
weapon
like
a
butcher
s
cleaver
in
the
other
i
rushed
across
the
bedroom
flung
open
the
window
and
looked
out
quiet
and
sweet
and
wholesome
the
garden
looked
in
the
moonlight
and
it
could
not
be
more
than
thirty
feet
down
i
clambered
out
upon
the
sill
but
i
hesitated
to
jump
until
i
should
have
heard
what
passed
between
my
saviour
and
the
ruffian
who
pursued
me
she
were
ill
used
then
at
any
risks
i
was
determined
to
go
back
to
her
assistance
thought
had
hardly
flashed
through
my
mind
before
he
was
at
the
door
pushing
his
way
past
her
but
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
and
tried
to
hold
him
back
she
cried
in
remember
your
promise
after
the
last
time
said
it
should
not
be
again
will
be
silent
he
will
be
silent
are
mad
he
shouted
struggling
to
break
away
from
her
will
be
the
ruin
of
us
has
seen
too
much
me
pass
i
say
dashed
her
to
one
side
and
rushing
to
the
window
cut
at
me
with
his
heavy
weapon
i
had
let
myself
go
and
was
hanging
by
the
hands
to
the
sill
when
his
blow
fell
i
was
conscious
of
a
dull
pain
my
grip
loosened
and
i
fell
into
the
garden
below
i
was
shaken
but
not
hurt
by
the
fall
so
i
picked
myself
up
and
rushed
off
among
the
bushes
as
hard
as
i
could
run
for
i
understood
that
i
was
far
from
being
out
of
danger
yet
however
as
i
ran
a
deadly
dizziness
and
sickness
came
over
me
i
glanced
down
at
my
hand
which
was
throbbing
painfully
and
then
for
the
first
time
saw
that
my
thumb
had
been
cut
off
and
that
the
blood
was
pouring
from
my
wound
i
endeavoured
to
tie
my
handkerchief
round
it
but
there
came
a
sudden
buzzing
in
my
ears
and
next
moment
i
fell
in
a
dead
faint
among
the
rose
bushes
long
i
remained
unconscious
i
cannot
tell
must
have
been
a
very
long
time
for
the
moon
had
sunk
and
a
bright
morning
was
breaking
when
i
came
to
myself
clothes
were
all
sodden
with
dew
and
my
coat
sleeve
was
drenched
with
blood
from
my
wounded
thumb
smarting
of
it
recalled
in
an
instant
all
the
particulars
of
my
night
s
adventure
and
i
sprang
to
my
feet
with
the
feeling
that
i
might
hardly
yet
be
safe
from
my
pursuers
to
my
astonishment
when
i
came
to
look
round
me
neither
house
nor
garden
were
to
be
seen
i
had
been
lying
in
an
angle
of
the
hedge
close
by
the
highroad
and
just
a
little
lower
down
was
a
long
building
which
proved
upon
my
approaching
it
to
be
the
very
station
at
which
i
had
arrived
upon
the
previous
night
it
not
for
the
ugly
wound
upon
my
hand
all
that
had
passed
during
those
dreadful
hours
might
have
been
an
evil
dream
dazed
i
went
into
the
station
and
asked
about
the
morning
train
would
be
one
to
in
less
than
an
hour
same
porter
was
on
duty
i
found
as
had
been
there
when
i
arrived
i
inquired
of
him
whether
he
had
ever
heard
of
name
was
strange
to
him
he
observed
a
carriage
the
night
before
waiting
for
me
he
had
not
there
a
police
station
anywhere
near
was
one
about
three
miles
off
was
too
far
for
me
to
go
weak
and
ill
as
i
was
i
determined
to
wait
until
i
got
back
to
town
before
telling
my
story
to
the
police
was
a
little
past
six
when
i
arrived
so
i
went
first
to
have
my
wound
dressed
and
then
the
doctor
was
kind
enough
to
bring
me
along
here
i
put
the
case
into
your
hands
and
shall
do
exactly
what
you
advise
both
sat
in
silence
for
some
little
time
after
listening
to
this
extraordinary
narrative
pulled
down
from
the
shelf
one
of
the
ponderous
commonplace
books
in
which
he
placed
his
cuttings
is
an
advertisement
which
will
interest
you
said
he
appeared
in
all
the
papers
about
a
year
ago
to
this
on
the
th
inst
aged
twenty
six
a
hydraulic
engineer
his
lodgings
at
ten
o
clock
at
night
and
has
not
been
heard
of
since
dressed
in
etc
etc
represents
the
last
time
that
the
colonel
needed
to
have
his
machine
overhauled
i
fancy
heavens
cried
my
patient
that
explains
what
the
girl
said
is
quite
clear
that
the
colonel
was
a
cool
and
desperate
man
who
was
absolutely
determined
that
nothing
should
stand
in
the
way
of
his
little
game
like
those
out
and
out
pirates
who
will
leave
no
survivor
from
a
captured
ship
every
moment
now
is
precious
so
if
you
feel
equal
to
it
we
shall
go
down
to
at
once
as
a
preliminary
to
starting
for
three
hours
or
so
afterwards
we
were
all
in
the
train
together
bound
from
to
the
little
village
were
the
hydraulic
engineer
of
a
plain
clothes
man
and
myself
had
spread
an
ordnance
map
of
the
county
out
upon
the
seat
and
was
busy
with
his
compasses
drawing
a
circle
with
for
its
centre
you
are
said
he
circle
is
drawn
at
a
radius
of
ten
miles
from
the
village
place
we
want
must
be
somewhere
near
that
line
said
ten
miles
i
think
sir
was
an
hour
s
good
drive
you
think
that
they
brought
you
back
all
that
way
when
you
were
unconscious
must
have
done
so
i
have
a
confused
memory
too
of
having
been
lifted
and
conveyed
somewhere
i
cannot
understand
said
i
is
why
they
should
have
spared
you
when
they
found
you
lying
fainting
in
the
garden
the
villain
was
softened
by
the
woman
s
entreaties
i
hardly
think
that
likely
i
never
saw
a
more
inexorable
face
in
my
life
we
shall
soon
clear
up
all
that
said
i
have
drawn
my
circle
and
i
only
wish
i
knew
at
what
point
upon
it
the
folk
that
we
are
in
search
of
are
to
be
found
i
think
i
could
lay
my
finger
on
it
said
quietly
now
cried
the
inspector
you
have
formed
your
opinion
now
we
shall
see
who
agrees
with
you
i
say
it
is
south
for
the
country
is
more
deserted
there
i
say
east
said
my
patient
i
am
for
west
remarked
the
plain
clothes
man
are
several
quiet
little
villages
up
there
i
am
for
north
said
i
because
there
are
no
hills
there
and
our
friend
says
that
he
did
not
notice
the
carriage
go
up
any
cried
the
inspector
laughing
it
s
a
very
pretty
diversity
of
opinion
have
boxed
the
compass
among
us
do
you
give
your
casting
vote
to
are
all
wrong
we
can
t
all
be
yes
you
can
is
my
point
placed
his
finger
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
is
where
we
shall
find
them
the
twelve
mile
drive
gasped
out
and
six
back
simpler
say
yourself
that
the
horse
was
fresh
and
glossy
when
you
got
in
could
it
be
that
if
it
had
gone
twelve
miles
over
heavy
roads
it
is
a
likely
ruse
enough
observed
thoughtfully
course
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
this
gang
at
all
said
are
coiners
on
a
large
scale
and
have
used
the
machine
to
form
the
amalgam
which
has
taken
the
place
of
silver
have
known
for
some
time
that
a
clever
gang
was
at
work
said
the
inspector
have
been
turning
out
half
crowns
by
the
thousand
even
traced
them
as
far
as
but
could
get
no
farther
for
they
had
covered
their
traces
in
a
way
that
showed
that
they
were
very
old
hands
now
thanks
to
this
lucky
chance
i
think
that
we
have
got
them
right
enough
the
inspector
was
mistaken
for
those
criminals
were
not
destined
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
justice
we
rolled
into
we
saw
a
gigantic
column
of
smoke
which
streamed
up
from
behind
a
small
clump
of
trees
in
the
neighbourhood
and
hung
like
an
immense
ostrich
feather
over
the
landscape
a
house
on
fire
asked
as
the
train
steamed
off
again
on
its
way
sir
said
the
station
master
did
it
break
out
i
hear
that
it
was
during
the
night
sir
but
it
has
got
worse
and
the
whole
place
is
in
a
blaze
house
is
it
s
me
broke
in
the
engineer
is
a
very
thin
with
a
long
sharp
nose
station
master
laughed
heartily
sir
is
an
and
there
isn
t
a
man
in
the
parish
who
has
a
better
lined
waistcoat
he
has
a
gentleman
staying
with
him
a
patient
as
i
understand
who
is
a
foreigner
and
he
looks
as
if
a
little
good
beef
would
do
him
no
harm
station
master
had
not
finished
his
speech
before
we
were
all
hastening
in
the
direction
of
the
fire
road
topped
a
low
hill
and
there
was
a
great
widespread
whitewashed
building
in
front
of
us
spouting
fire
at
every
chink
and
window
while
in
the
garden
in
front
three
fire
engines
were
vainly
striving
to
keep
the
flames
under
s
it
cried
in
intense
excitement
is
the
gravel
drive
and
there
are
the
rose
bushes
where
i
lay
second
window
is
the
one
that
i
jumped
from
at
least
said
you
have
had
your
revenge
upon
them
can
be
no
question
that
it
was
your
oil
lamp
which
when
it
was
crushed
in
the
press
set
fire
to
the
wooden
walls
though
no
doubt
they
were
too
excited
in
the
chase
after
you
to
observe
it
at
the
time
keep
your
eyes
open
in
this
crowd
for
your
friends
of
last
night
though
i
very
much
fear
that
they
are
a
good
hundred
miles
off
by
now
fears
came
to
be
realised
for
from
that
day
to
this
no
word
has
ever
been
heard
either
of
the
beautiful
woman
the
sinister
or
the
morose
that
morning
a
peasant
had
met
a
cart
containing
several
people
and
some
very
bulky
boxes
driving
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
but
there
all
traces
of
the
fugitives
disappeared
and
even
ingenuity
failed
ever
to
discover
the
least
clue
as
to
their
whereabouts
firemen
had
been
much
perturbed
at
the
strange
arrangements
which
they
had
found
within
and
still
more
so
by
discovering
a
newly
severed
human
thumb
upon
a
window
sill
of
the
second
floor
sunset
however
their
efforts
were
at
last
successful
and
they
subdued
the
flames
but
not
before
the
roof
had
fallen
in
and
the
whole
place
been
reduced
to
such
absolute
ruin
that
save
some
twisted
cylinders
and
iron
piping
not
a
trace
remained
of
the
machinery
which
had
cost
our
unfortunate
acquaintance
so
dearly
masses
of
nickel
and
of
tin
were
discovered
stored
in
an
out
house
but
no
coins
were
to
be
found
which
may
have
explained
the
presence
of
those
bulky
boxes
which
have
been
already
referred
to
our
hydraulic
engineer
had
been
conveyed
from
the
garden
to
the
spot
where
he
recovered
his
senses
might
have
remained
forever
a
mystery
were
it
not
for
the
soft
mould
which
told
us
a
very
plain
tale
had
evidently
been
carried
down
by
two
persons
one
of
whom
had
remarkably
small
feet
and
the
other
unusually
large
ones
the
whole
it
was
most
probable
that
the
silent
being
less
bold
or
less
murderous
than
his
companion
had
assisted
the
woman
to
bear
the
unconscious
man
out
of
the
way
of
danger
said
our
engineer
ruefully
as
we
took
our
seats
to
return
once
more
to
it
has
been
a
pretty
business
for
me
i
have
lost
my
thumb
and
i
have
lost
a
fifty
guinea
fee
and
what
have
i
gained
said
laughing
it
may
be
of
value
you
know
you
have
only
to
put
it
into
words
to
gain
the
reputation
of
being
excellent
company
for
the
remainder
of
your
existence
x
the
adventure
of
the
noble
bachelor
marriage
and
its
curious
termination
have
long
ceased
to
be
a
subject
of
interest
in
those
exalted
circles
in
which
the
unfortunate
bridegroom
moves
scandals
have
eclipsed
it
and
their
more
piquant
details
have
drawn
the
gossips
away
from
this
four
year
old
drama
i
have
reason
to
believe
however
that
the
full
facts
have
never
been
revealed
to
the
general
public
and
as
my
friend
had
a
considerable
share
in
clearing
the
matter
up
i
feel
that
no
memoir
of
him
would
be
complete
without
some
little
sketch
of
this
remarkable
episode
was
a
few
weeks
before
my
own
marriage
during
the
days
when
i
was
still
sharing
rooms
with
in
that
he
came
home
from
an
afternoon
stroll
to
find
a
letter
on
the
table
waiting
for
him
i
had
remained
indoors
all
day
for
the
weather
had
taken
a
sudden
turn
to
rain
with
high
autumnal
winds
and
the
bullet
which
i
had
brought
back
in
one
of
my
limbs
as
a
relic
of
my
campaign
throbbed
with
dull
persistence
my
body
in
one
easy
chair
and
my
legs
upon
another
i
had
surrounded
myself
with
a
cloud
of
newspapers
until
at
last
saturated
with
the
news
of
the
day
i
tossed
them
all
aside
and
lay
listless
watching
the
huge
crest
and
monogram
upon
the
envelope
upon
the
table
and
wondering
lazily
who
my
friend
s
noble
correspondent
could
be
is
a
very
fashionable
epistle
i
remarked
as
he
entered
morning
letters
if
i
remember
right
were
from
a
fish
monger
and
a
tide
waiter
my
correspondence
has
certainly
the
charm
of
variety
he
answered
smiling
and
the
humbler
are
usually
the
more
interesting
looks
like
one
of
those
unwelcome
social
summonses
which
call
upon
a
man
either
to
be
bored
or
to
lie
broke
the
seal
and
glanced
over
the
contents
come
it
may
prove
to
be
something
of
interest
after
all
social
then
distinctly
professional
from
a
noble
client
of
the
highest
in
dear
fellow
i
congratulate
you
i
assure
you
without
affectation
that
the
status
of
my
client
is
a
matter
of
less
moment
to
me
than
the
interest
of
his
case
is
just
possible
however
that
that
also
may
not
be
wanting
in
this
new
investigation
have
been
reading
the
papers
diligently
of
late
have
you
not
looks
like
it
said
i
ruefully
pointing
to
a
huge
bundle
in
the
corner
i
have
had
nothing
else
to
do
is
fortunate
for
you
will
perhaps
be
able
to
post
me
up
i
read
nothing
except
the
criminal
news
and
the
agony
column
latter
is
always
instructive
if
you
have
followed
recent
events
so
closely
you
must
have
read
about
and
his
wedding
yes
with
the
deepest
interest
is
well
letter
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
is
from
i
will
read
it
to
you
and
in
return
you
must
turn
over
these
papers
and
let
me
have
whatever
bears
upon
the
matter
is
what
he
says
my
dear
mr
sherlock
holmes
tells
me
that
i
may
place
implicit
reliance
upon
your
judgment
and
discretion
i
have
determined
therefore
to
call
upon
you
and
to
consult
you
in
reference
to
the
very
painful
event
which
has
occurred
in
connection
with
my
wedding
of
is
acting
already
in
the
matter
but
he
assures
me
that
he
sees
no
objection
to
your
co
operation
and
that
he
even
thinks
that
it
might
be
of
some
assistance
i
will
call
at
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
and
should
you
have
any
other
engagement
at
that
time
i
hope
that
you
will
postpone
it
as
this
matter
is
of
paramount
importance
faithfully
st
simon
is
dated
from
written
with
a
quill
pen
and
the
noble
lord
has
had
the
misfortune
to
get
a
smear
of
ink
upon
the
outer
side
of
his
right
little
finger
remarked
as
he
folded
up
the
epistle
says
four
o
clock
is
three
now
will
be
here
in
an
hour
i
have
just
time
with
your
assistance
to
get
clear
upon
the
subject
over
those
papers
and
arrange
the
extracts
in
their
order
of
time
while
i
take
a
glance
as
to
who
our
client
is
picked
a
red
covered
volume
from
a
line
of
books
of
reference
beside
the
mantelpiece
he
is
said
he
sitting
down
and
flattening
it
out
upon
his
knee
de
second
son
of
the
of
three
caltrops
in
chief
over
a
fess
sable
in
s
forty
one
years
of
age
which
is
mature
for
marriage
for
the
colonies
in
a
late
administration
his
father
was
at
one
time
for
inherit
blood
by
direct
descent
and
on
the
distaff
side
there
is
nothing
very
instructive
in
all
this
i
think
that
i
must
turn
to
you
for
something
more
solid
i
have
very
little
difficulty
in
finding
what
i
want
said
i
for
the
facts
are
quite
recent
and
the
matter
struck
me
as
remarkable
i
feared
to
refer
them
to
you
however
as
i
knew
that
you
had
an
inquiry
on
hand
and
that
you
disliked
the
intrusion
of
other
matters
you
mean
the
little
problem
of
the
furniture
van
is
quite
cleared
up
now
though
indeed
it
was
obvious
from
the
first
give
me
the
results
of
your
newspaper
selections
is
the
first
notice
which
i
can
find
is
in
the
personal
column
of
the
and
dates
as
you
see
some
weeks
back
a
marriage
has
been
arranged
it
says
and
will
if
rumour
is
correct
very
shortly
take
place
between
second
son
of
the
of
and
the
only
daughter
of
of
u
s
a
is
all
and
to
the
point
remarked
stretching
his
long
thin
legs
towards
the
fire
was
a
paragraph
amplifying
this
in
one
of
the
society
papers
of
the
same
week
here
it
is
will
soon
be
a
call
for
protection
in
the
marriage
market
for
the
present
free
trade
principle
appears
to
tell
heavily
against
our
home
product
by
one
the
management
of
the
noble
houses
of
is
passing
into
the
hands
of
our
fair
cousins
from
across
the
important
addition
has
been
made
during
the
last
week
to
the
list
of
the
prizes
which
have
been
borne
away
by
these
charming
invaders
who
has
shown
himself
for
over
twenty
years
proof
against
the
little
god
s
arrows
has
now
definitely
announced
his
approaching
marriage
with
the
fascinating
daughter
of
a
millionaire
whose
graceful
figure
and
striking
face
attracted
much
attention
at
the
festivities
is
an
only
child
and
it
is
currently
reported
that
her
dowry
will
run
to
considerably
over
the
six
figures
with
expectancies
for
the
future
it
is
an
open
secret
that
the
of
has
been
compelled
to
sell
his
pictures
within
the
last
few
years
and
as
has
no
property
of
his
own
save
the
small
estate
of
it
is
obvious
that
the
heiress
is
not
the
only
gainer
by
an
alliance
which
will
enable
her
to
make
the
easy
and
common
transition
from
a
lady
to
a
peeress
else
asked
yawning
yes
plenty
there
is
another
note
in
the
to
say
that
the
marriage
would
be
an
absolutely
quiet
one
that
it
would
be
at
s
that
only
half
a
dozen
intimate
friends
would
be
invited
and
that
the
party
would
return
to
the
furnished
house
at
which
has
been
taken
by
days
later
that
is
on
last
there
is
a
curt
announcement
that
the
wedding
had
taken
place
and
that
the
honeymoon
would
be
passed
at
s
place
near
are
all
the
notices
which
appeared
before
the
disappearance
of
the
bride
the
what
asked
with
a
start
vanishing
of
the
lady
did
she
vanish
then
the
wedding
breakfast
is
more
interesting
than
it
promised
to
be
quite
dramatic
in
fact
it
struck
me
as
being
a
little
out
of
the
common
often
vanish
before
the
ceremony
and
occasionally
during
the
honeymoon
but
i
cannot
call
to
mind
anything
quite
so
prompt
as
this
let
me
have
the
details
i
warn
you
that
they
are
very
incomplete
we
may
make
them
less
so
as
they
are
they
are
set
forth
in
a
single
article
of
a
morning
paper
of
yesterday
which
i
will
read
to
you
is
headed
at
a
family
of
has
been
thrown
into
the
greatest
consternation
by
the
strange
and
painful
episodes
which
have
taken
place
in
connection
with
his
wedding
ceremony
as
shortly
announced
in
the
papers
of
yesterday
occurred
on
the
previous
morning
but
it
is
only
now
that
it
has
been
possible
to
confirm
the
strange
rumours
which
have
been
so
persistently
floating
about
spite
of
the
attempts
of
the
friends
to
hush
the
matter
up
so
much
public
attention
has
now
been
drawn
to
it
that
no
good
purpose
can
be
served
by
affecting
to
disregard
what
is
a
common
subject
for
conversation
ceremony
which
was
performed
at
s
was
a
very
quiet
one
no
one
being
present
save
the
father
of
the
bride
the
of
and
the
younger
brother
and
sister
of
the
bridegroom
and
whole
party
proceeded
afterwards
to
the
house
of
at
where
breakfast
had
been
prepared
appears
that
some
little
trouble
was
caused
by
a
woman
whose
name
has
not
been
ascertained
who
endeavoured
to
force
her
way
into
the
house
after
the
bridal
party
alleging
that
she
had
some
claim
upon
was
only
after
a
painful
and
prolonged
scene
that
she
was
ejected
by
the
butler
and
the
footman
bride
who
had
fortunately
entered
the
house
before
this
unpleasant
interruption
had
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
the
rest
when
she
complained
of
a
sudden
indisposition
and
retired
to
her
room
prolonged
absence
having
caused
some
comment
her
father
followed
her
but
learned
from
her
maid
that
she
had
only
come
up
to
her
chamber
for
an
instant
caught
up
an
ulster
and
bonnet
and
hurried
down
to
the
passage
of
the
footmen
declared
that
he
had
seen
a
lady
leave
the
house
thus
apparelled
but
had
refused
to
credit
that
it
was
his
mistress
believing
her
to
be
with
the
company
ascertaining
that
his
daughter
had
disappeared
in
conjunction
with
the
bridegroom
instantly
put
themselves
in
communication
with
the
police
and
very
energetic
inquiries
are
being
made
which
will
probably
result
in
a
speedy
clearing
up
of
this
very
singular
business
to
a
late
hour
last
night
however
nothing
had
transpired
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
missing
lady
are
rumours
of
foul
play
in
the
matter
and
it
is
said
that
the
police
have
caused
the
arrest
of
the
woman
who
had
caused
the
original
disturbance
in
the
belief
that
from
jealousy
or
some
other
motive
she
may
have
been
concerned
in
the
strange
disappearance
of
the
bride
is
that
all
one
little
item
in
another
of
the
morning
papers
but
it
is
a
suggestive
one
it
is
the
lady
who
had
caused
the
disturbance
has
actually
been
arrested
appears
that
she
was
formerly
a
danseuse
at
the
and
that
she
has
known
the
bridegroom
for
some
years
are
no
further
particulars
and
the
whole
case
is
in
your
hands
now
so
far
as
it
has
been
set
forth
in
the
public
press
an
exceedingly
interesting
case
it
appears
to
be
i
would
not
have
missed
it
for
worlds
there
is
a
ring
at
the
bell
and
as
the
clock
makes
it
a
few
minutes
after
four
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
will
prove
to
be
our
noble
client
not
dream
of
going
for
i
very
much

a

my

boy
throwing
open
the
door
a
gentleman
entered
with
a
pleasant
cultured
face
high
nosed
and
pale
with
something
perhaps
of
petulance
about
the
mouth
and
with
the
steady
well
opened
eye
of

obeyed

brisk
and
yet
his
general
appearance
gave
an
undue
impression
of
age

a
slight
forward

talk
this
matter
over
a
most
painful
matter
to
me

you

cut
to
the

anyone

think
that
i
may
arrive

my
facts

directly

is
your
own
impression
as

the
young
lady

your

his
glasses

he
my
wife
was
twenty
before
her
father
became
a
rich
man
that
time
she
ran
free
in
a
mining
camp
and
wandered
through
woods
or
mountains
so
that
her
education
has
come
from
rather
than
from
the
schoolmaster

what
we
call
in

any
sort

i
was
about
to
say
is
swift
in
making
up
her
mind
and
fearless
in
carrying
out
her
resolutions
the
other
hand
i
would
not
have
given
her
the
name
which
i
have
the
honour
to
bear

gave
a
little
stately
cough
had
not
i
thought
her
to
be
at
bottom
a
noble
woman
i
believe
that
she
is
capable
of
heroic
self
sacrifice
and
that
anything
dishonourable
would
be
repugnant
to
her
you
her
photograph
i
brought
this
with
me
opened
a
locket
and
showed
us
the
full
face
of
a
very
lovely
woman
was
not
a
photograph
but
an
ivory
miniature
and
the
artist
had
brought
out
the
full
effect
of
the
lustrous
black
hair
the
large
dark
eyes
and
the
exquisite
mouth
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
it
he
closed
the
locket
and
handed
it
back
to
young
lady
came
to
then
and
you
renewed
your
acquaintance
her
father
brought
her
over
for
this
last
season
i
met
her
several
times
became
engaged
to
her
and
have
now
married
her
brought
i
understand
a
considerable
dowry
a
fair
dowry
more
than
is
usual
in
my
family
this
of
course
remains
to
you
since
the
marriage
is
a
fait
accompli
i
really
have
made
no
inquiries
on
the
subject
naturally
not
you
see
on
the
day
before
the
wedding
she
in
good
spirits
better
kept
talking
of
what
we
should
do
in
our
future
lives
is
very
interesting
on
the
morning
of
the
wedding
was
as
bright
as
possible
at
least
until
after
the
ceremony
did
you
observe
any
change
in
her
then
to
tell
the
truth
i
saw
then
the
first
signs
that
i
had
ever
seen
that
her
temper
was
just
a
little
sharp
incident
however
was
too
trivial
to
relate
and
can
have
no
possible
bearing
upon
the
case
let
us
have
it
for
all
that
it
is
childish
dropped
her
bouquet
as
we
went
towards
the
vestry
was
passing
the
front
pew
at
the
time
and
it
fell
over
into
the
pew
was
a
moment
s
delay
but
the
gentleman
in
the
pew
handed
it
up
to
her
again
and
it
did
not
appear
to
be
the
worse
for
the
fall
when
i
spoke
to
her
of
the
matter
she
answered
me
abruptly
and
in
the
carriage
on
our
way
home
she
seemed
absurdly
agitated
over
this
trifling
cause
say
that
there
was
a
gentleman
in
the
pew
of
the
general
public
were
present
then
yes
is
impossible
to
exclude
them
when
the
church
is
open
gentleman
was
not
one
of
your
wife
s
friends
no
i
call
him
a
gentleman
by
courtesy
but
he
was
quite
a
common
looking
person
i
hardly
noticed
his
appearance
really
i
think
that
we
are
wandering
rather
far
from
the
point
then
returned
from
the
wedding
in
a
less
cheerful
frame
of
mind
than
she
had
gone
to
it
did
she
do
on
re
entering
her
father
s
house
i
saw
her
in
conversation
with
her
maid
who
is
her
maid
is
her
name
is
an
and
came
from
with
her
a
confidential
servant
a
little
too
much
so
seemed
to
me
that
her
mistress
allowed
her
to
take
great
liberties
of
course
in
they
look
upon
these
things
in
a
different
way
long
did
she
speak
to
this
a
few
minutes
i
had
something
else
to
think
of
did
not
overhear
what
they
said
said
something
about
jumping
a
claim
was
accustomed
to
use
slang
of
the
kind
i
have
no
idea
what
she
meant
slang
is
very
expressive
sometimes
what
did
your
wife
do
when
she
finished
speaking
to
her
maid
walked
into
the
breakfast
room
your
arm
alone
was
very
independent
in
little
matters
like
that
after
we
had
sat
down
for
ten
minutes
or
so
she
rose
hurriedly
muttered
some
words
of
apology
and
left
the
room
never
came
back
this
maid
as
i
understand
deposes
that
she
went
to
her
room
covered
her
bride
s
dress
with
a
long
ulster
put
on
a
bonnet
and
went
out
so
she
was
afterwards
seen
walking
into
in
company
with
a
woman
who
is
now
in
custody
and
who
had
already
made
a
disturbance
at
s
house
that
morning
yes
i
should
like
a
few
particulars
as
to
this
young
lady
and
your
relations
to
her
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
raised
his
eyebrows
have
been
on
a
friendly
footing
for
some
years
i
may
say
on
a
very
friendly
footing
used
to
be
at
the
i
have
not
treated
her
ungenerously
and
she
had
no
just
cause
of
complaint
against
me
but
you
know
what
women
are
was
a
dear
little
thing
but
exceedingly
hot
headed
and
devotedly
attached
to
me
wrote
me
dreadful
letters
when
she
heard
that
i
was
about
to
be
married
and
to
tell
the
truth
the
reason
why
i
had
the
marriage
celebrated
so
quietly
was
that
i
feared
lest
there
might
be
a
scandal
in
the
church
came
to
s
door
just
after
we
returned
and
she
endeavoured
to
push
her
way
in
uttering
very
abusive
expressions
towards
my
wife
and
even
threatening
her
but
i
had
foreseen
the
possibility
of
something
of
the
sort
and
i
had
two
police
fellows
there
in
private
clothes
who
soon
pushed
her
out
again
was
quiet
when
she
saw
that
there
was
no
good
in
making
a
row
your
wife
hear
all
this
thank
goodness
she
did
not
she
was
seen
walking
with
this
very
woman
afterwards
is
what
of
looks
upon
as
so
serious
is
thought
that
decoyed
my
wife
out
and
laid
some
terrible
trap
for
her
it
is
a
possible
supposition
think
so
too
i
did
not
say
a
probable
one
you
do
not
yourself
look
upon
this
as
likely
i
do
not
think
would
hurt
a
fly
jealousy
is
a
strange
transformer
of
characters
what
is
your
own
theory
as
to
what
took
place
really
i
came
to
seek
a
theory
not
to
propound
one
i
have
given
you
all
the
facts
you
ask
me
however
i
may
say
that
it
has
occurred
to
me
as
possible
that
the
excitement
of
this
affair
the
consciousness
that
she
had
made
so
immense
a
social
stride
had
the
effect
of
causing
some
little
nervous
disturbance
in
my
wife
short
that
she
had
become
suddenly
deranged
really
when
i
consider
that
she
has
turned
her
back
i
will
not
say
upon
me
but
upon
so
much
that
many
have
aspired
to
without
success
i
can
hardly
explain
it
in
any
other
fashion
certainly
that
is
also
a
conceivable
hypothesis
said
smiling
now
i
think
that
i
have
nearly
all
my
data
i
ask
whether
you
were
seated
at
the
breakfast
table
so
that
you
could
see
out
of
the
window
could
see
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
the
so
i
do
not
think
that
i
need
to
detain
you
longer
i
shall
communicate
with
you
you
be
fortunate
enough
to
solve
this
problem
said
our
client
rising
i
have
solved
it
was
that
i
say
that
i
have
solved
it
then
is
my
wife
is
a
detail
which
i
shall
speedily
supply
shook
his
head
i
am
afraid
that
it
will
take
wiser
heads
than
yours
or
mine
he
remarked
and
bowing
in
a
stately
old
fashioned
manner
he
departed
is
very
good
of
to
honour
my
head
by
putting
it
on
a
level
with
his
own
said
laughing
i
think
that
i
shall
have
a
whisky
and
soda
and
a
cigar
after
all
this
cross
questioning
i
had
formed
my
conclusions
as
to
the
case
before
our
client
came
into
the
room
dear
i
have
notes
of
several
similar
cases
though
none
as
i
remarked
before
which
were
quite
as
prompt
whole
examination
served
to
turn
my
conjecture
into
a
certainty
evidence
is
occasionally
very
convincing
as
when
you
find
a
trout
in
the
milk
to
quote
s
example
i
have
heard
all
that
you
have
heard
however
the
knowledge
of
pre
existing
cases
which
serves
me
so
well
was
a
parallel
instance
in
some
years
back
and
something
on
very
much
the
same
lines
at
the
year
after
the
is
one
of
these
cases
but
hullo
here
is

find

attired
in
a
pea
jacket
and
cravat
which
gave
him
a
decidedly
nautical
appearance
and
he
carried
a
black
canvas
bag
in
his
hand
a
short
greeting
he
seated
himself
and
lit
the

had
been
offered
to
him

asked
with
a
twinkle

dissatisfied
i
feel
dissatisfied
is
this
infernal
marriage
case
i
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
the
business
surprise
me
ever
heard
of
such
a
mixed
affair
clue
seems
to
slip
through
my
fingers
i
have
been
at
work
upon
it
all
day
very
wet
it
seems
to
have
made
you
said
laying
his
hand
upon
the
arm
of
the

back
in

chair
and
laughed
heartily
you
dragged

basin
of

he
asked
do
you
mean
you
have
just
as
good
a
chance
of
finding
this
lady
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
shot
an
angry
glance
at
my
companion
i
suppose
you
know
all
about
it
he
snarled
i
have
only
just
heard
the
facts
but
my
mind
is
made
up
indeed
you
think
that
the
plays
no
part
in
the
matter
i
think
it
very
unlikely
perhaps
you
will
kindly
explain
how
it
is
that
we
found
this
in
it
opened
his
bag
as
he
spoke
and
tumbled
onto
the
floor
a
wedding
dress
of
watered
silk
a
pair
of
white
satin
shoes
and
a
bride
s
wreath
and
veil
all
discoloured
and
soaked
in
water
said
he
putting
a
new
wedding
ring
upon
the
top
of
the
pile
is
a
little
nut
for
you
to
crack

said
my
friend

them
from

floating
near
the
margin
by
a
park
keeper
have
been
identified
as
her
clothes
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
the
clothes
were
there
the
body
would
not
be
far
off
the
same
brilliant
reasoning
every

to
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
wardrobe
pray
what
did
you
hope
to
arrive
at
through
this
some
evidence
implicating
in
the
disappearance
i
am
afraid
that
you
will
find
it
difficult
you
indeed
now
cried
with
some
bitterness
i
am
afraid
that
you
are
not
very
practical
with
your
deductions
and
your
inferences
have
made
two
blunders
in
as
many
minutes
dress
does
implicate
how
the
dress
is
a
pocket
the
pocket
is
a
card
case
the
card
case
is
a
note
here
is
the
very
note
slapped
it
down
upon
the
table
in
front
of
him
to
this
will
see
me
when
all
is
ready
at
once
f
h
m
my
theory
all
along
has
been
that
was
decoyed
away
by
and
that
she
with
confederates
no
doubt
was
responsible
for
her
disappearance
signed
with
her
initials
is
the
very
note
which
was
no
doubt
quietly
slipped
into
her
hand
at
the
door
and
which
lured
her
within
their
reach
good
said
laughing
really
are
very
fine
indeed
me
see
it
took
up
the
paper
in
a
listless
way
but
his
attention
instantly
became
riveted
and
he
gave
a
little
cry
of
satisfaction
is
indeed
important
said
he
you
find
it
so
so
i
congratulate
you
warmly
rose
in
his
triumph
and
bent
his
head
to
look
he
shrieked
you
re
looking
at
the
wrong
side
the
contrary
this
is
the
right
side
right
side
re
mad
is
the
note
written
in
pencil
over
here
over
here
is
what
appears
to
be
the
fragment
of
a
hotel
bill
which
interests
me
deeply
s
nothing
in
it
i
looked
at
it
before
said
th
rooms

s
d
cocktail
s
lunch
s
d

d
i
see
nothing
in
that
likely
not
is
most
important
all
the
same
to
the
note
it
is
important
also
or
at
least
the
initials
are
so
i
congratulate
you
again
i
ve
wasted
time
enough
said
rising
i
believe
in
hard
work
and
not
in
sitting
by
the
fire
spinning
fine
theories
day
and
we
shall
see
which
gets
to
the
bottom
of
the
matter
first
gathered
up
the
garments
thrust
them
into
the
bag
and
made
for
the
door
one
hint
to
you
drawled
before
his
rival
vanished
i
will
tell
you
the
true
solution
of
the
matter
is
a
myth
is
not
and
there
never
has
been
any
such
person
looked
sadly
at
my
companion
he
turned
to
me
tapped
his
forehead
three
times
shook
his
head
solemnly
and
hurried
away
had
hardly
shut
the
door
behind
him
when
rose
to
put
on
his
overcoat
is
something
in
what
the
fellow
says
about
outdoor
work
he
remarked
so
i
think
that
i
must
leave
you
to
your
papers
for
a
little
was
after
five
o
clock
when
left
me
but
i
had
no
time
to
be
lonely
for
within
an
hour
there
arrived
a
confectioner
s
man
with
a
very
large
flat
box
he
unpacked
with
the
help
of
a
youth
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
and
presently
to
my
very
great
astonishment
a
quite
epicurean
little
cold
supper
began
to
be
laid
out
upon
our
humble
lodging
house
mahogany
were
a
couple
of
brace
of
cold
woodcock
a
pheasant
a
p
t
de
foie
gras
pie
with
a
group
of
ancient
and
cobwebby
bottles
laid
out
all
these
luxuries
my
two
visitors
vanished
away
like
the
genii
of
the
with
no
explanation
save
that
the
things
had
been
paid
for
and
were
ordered
to
this
address
before
nine
o
clock
stepped
briskly
into
the
room
features
were
gravely
set
but
there
was
a
light
in
his
eye
which
made
me
think
that
he
had
not
been
disappointed
in
his
conclusions
have
laid
the
supper
then
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
seem
to
expect
company
have
laid
for
five
i
fancy
we
may
have
some
company
dropping
in
said
he
i
am
surprised
that
has
not
already
arrived
i
fancy
that
i
hear
his
step
now
upon
the
stairs
was
indeed
our
visitor
of
the
afternoon
who
came
bustling
in
dangling
his
glasses
more
vigorously
than
ever
and
with
a
very
perturbed
expression
upon
his
aristocratic
features
messenger
reached
you
then
asked
and
i
confess
that
the
contents
startled
me
beyond
measure
you
good
authority
for
what
you
say
best
possible
sank
into
a
chair
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
will
the
say
he
murmured
when
he
hears
that
one
of
the
family
has
been
subjected
to
such
humiliation
is
the
purest
accident
i
cannot
allow
that
there
is
any
humiliation
you
look
on
these
things
from
another
standpoint
i
fail
to
see
that
anyone
is
to
blame
i
can
hardly
see
how
the
lady
could
have
acted
otherwise
though
her
abrupt
method
of
doing
it
was
undoubtedly
to
be
regretted
no
mother
she
had
no
one
to
advise
her
at
such
a
crisis
was
a
slight
sir
a
public
slight
said
tapping
his
fingers
upon
the
table
must
make
allowance
for
this
poor
girl
placed
in
so
unprecedented
a
position
i
will
make
no
allowance
i
am
very
angry
indeed
and
i
have
been
shamefully
used
i
think
that
i
heard
a
ring
said
there
are
steps
on
the
landing
i
cannot
persuade
you
to
take
a
lenient
view
of
the
matter
i
have
brought
an
advocate
here
who
may
be
more
successful
opened
the
door
and
ushered
in
a
lady
and
gentleman
said
he
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
and
lady
i
think
you
have
already
met
the
sight
of
these
newcomers
our
client
had
sprung
from
his
seat
and
stood
very
erect
with
his
eyes
cast
down
and
his
hand
thrust
into
the
breast
of
his
frock
coat
a
picture
of
offended
dignity
lady
had
taken
a
quick
step
forward
and
had
held
out
her
hand
to
him
but
he
still
refused
to
raise
his
eyes
was
as
well
for
his
resolution
perhaps
for
her
pleading
face
was
one
which
it
was
hard
to
resist
re
angry
said
she
i
guess
you
have
every
cause
to
be
make
no
apology
to
me
said
bitterly
yes
i
know
that
i
have
treated
you
real
bad
and
that
i
should
have
spoken
to
you
before
i
went
but
i
was
kind
of
rattled
and
from
the
time
when
i
saw
here
again
i
just
didn
t
know
what
i
was
doing
or
saying
i
only
wonder
i
didn
t
fall
down
and
do
a
faint
right
there
before
the
altar
you
would
like
my
friend
and
me
to
leave
the
room
while
you
explain
this
matter
i
may
give
an
opinion
remarked
the
strange
gentleman
we
ve
had
just
a
little
too
much
secrecy
over
this
business
already
my
part
i
should
like
all
and
to
hear
the
rights
of
it
was
a
small
wiry
sunburnt
man
clean
shaven
with
a
sharp
face
and
alert
manner
i
ll
tell
our
story
right
away
said
the
lady
here
and
i
met
in
in
s
camp
near
the
where
pa
was
working
a
claim
were
engaged
to
each
other
and
i
but
then
one
day
father
struck
a
rich
pocket
and
made
a
pile
while
poor
here
had
a
claim
that
petered
out
and
came
to
nothing
richer
pa
grew
the
poorer
was
so
at
last
pa
wouldn
t
hear
of
our
engagement
lasting
any
longer
and
he
took
me
away
to
wouldn
t
throw
up
his
hand
though
so
he
followed
me
there
and
he
saw
me
without
pa
knowing
anything
about
it
would
only
have
made
him
mad
to
know
so
we
just
fixed
it
all
up
for
ourselves
said
that
he
would
go
and
make
his
pile
too
and
never
come
back
to
claim
me
until
he
had
as
much
as
pa
then
i
promised
to
wait
for
him
to
the
end
of
time
and
pledged
myself
not
to
marry
anyone
else
while
he
lived
shouldn
t
we
be
married
right
away
then
said
he
and
then
i
will
feel
sure
of
you
and
i
won
t
claim
to
be
your
husband
until
i
come
back
we
talked
it
over
and
he
had
fixed
it
all
up
so
nicely
with
a
clergyman
all
ready
in
waiting
that
we
just
did
it
right
there
and
then
went
off
to
seek
his
fortune
and
i
went
back
to
pa
next
i
heard
of
was
that
he
was
in
and
then
he
went
prospecting
in
and
then
i
heard
of
him
from
that
came
a
long
newspaper
story
about
how
a
miners
camp
had
been
attacked
by
and
there
was
my
s
name
among
the
killed
i
fainted
dead
away
and
i
was
very
sick
for
months
after
thought
i
had
a
decline
and
took
me
to
half
the
doctors
in
a
word
of
news
came
for
a
year
and
more
so
that
i
never
doubted
that
was
really
dead
came
to
and
we
came
to
and
a
marriage
was
arranged
and
pa
was
very
pleased
but
i
felt
all
the
time
that
no
man
on
this
earth
would
ever
take
the
place
in
my
heart
that
had
been
given
to
my
poor
if
i
had
married
of
course
i
d
have
done
my
duty
by
him
can
t
command
our
love
but
we
can
our
actions
i
went
to
the
altar
with
him
with
the
intention
to
make
him
just
as
good
a
wife
as
it
was
in
me
to
be
you
may
imagine
what
i
felt
when
just
as
i
came
to
the
altar
rails
i
glanced
back
and
saw
standing
and
looking
at
me
out
of
the
first
pew
i
thought
it
was
his
ghost
at
first
but
when
i
looked
again
there
he
was
still
with
a
kind
of
question
in
his
eyes
as
if
to
ask
me
whether
i
were
glad
or
sorry
to
see
him
i
wonder
i
didn
t
drop
i
know
that
everything
was
turning
round
and
the
words
of
the
clergyman
were
just
like
the
buzz
of
a
bee
in
my
ear
i
didn
t
know
what
to
do
i
stop
the
service
and
make
a
scene
in
the
church
i
glanced
at
him
again
and
he
seemed
to
know
what
i
was
thinking
for
he
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
to
tell
me
to
be
still
i
saw
him
scribble
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
i
knew
that
he
was
writing
me
a
note
i
passed
his
pew
on
the
way
out
i
dropped
my
bouquet
over
to
him
and
he
slipped
the
note
into
my
hand
when
he
returned
me
the
flowers
was
only
a
line
asking
me
to
join
him
when
he
made
the
sign
to
me
to
do
so
course
i
never
doubted
for
a
moment
that
my
first
duty
was
now
to
him
and
i
determined
to
do
just
whatever
he
might
direct
i
got
back
i
told
my
maid
who
had
known
him
in
and
had
always
been
his
friend
i
ordered
her
to
say
nothing
but
to
get
a
few
things
packed
and
my
ulster
ready
i
know
i
ought
to
have
spoken
to
but
it
was
dreadful
hard
before
his
mother
and
all
those
great
people
i
just
made
up
my
mind
to
run
away
and
explain
afterwards
i
hadn
t
been
at
the
table
ten
minutes
before
i
saw
out
of
the
window
at
the
other
side
of
the
road
beckoned
to
me
and
then
began
walking
into
the
i
slipped
out
put
on
my
things
and
followed
him
woman
came
talking
something
or
other
about
to
me
seemed
to
me
from
the
little
i
heard
as
if
he
had
a
little
secret
of
his
own
before
marriage
also
but
i
managed
to
get
away
from
her
and
soon
overtook
got
into
a
cab
together
and
away
we
drove
to
some
lodgings
he
had
taken
in
and
that
was
my
true
wedding
after
all
those
years
of
waiting
had
been
a
prisoner
among
the
had
escaped
came
on
to
found
that
i
had
given
him
up
for
dead
and
had
gone
to
followed
me
there
and
had
come
upon
me
at
last
on
the
very
morning
of
my
second
wedding
i
saw
it
in
a
paper
explained
the
gave
the
name
and
the
church
but
not
where
the
lady
lived
we
had
a
talk
as
to
what
we
should
do
and
was
all
for
openness
but
i
was
so
ashamed
of
it
all
that
i
felt
as
if
i
should
like
to
vanish
away
and
never
see
any
of
them
again
just
sending
a
line
to
pa
perhaps
to
show
him
that
i
was
alive
was
awful
to
me
to
think
of
all
those
lords
and
ladies
sitting
round
that
breakfast
table
and
waiting
for
me
to
come
back
took
my
wedding
clothes
and
things
and
made
a
bundle
of
them
so
that
i
should
not
be
traced
and
dropped
them
away
somewhere
where
no
one
could
find
them
is
likely
that
we
should
have
gone
on
to
to
morrow
only
that
this
good
gentleman
came
round
to
us
this
evening
though
how
he
found
us
is
more
than
i
can
think
and
he
showed
us
very
clearly
and
kindly
that
i
was
wrong
and
that
was
right
and
that
we
should
be
putting
ourselves
in
the
wrong
if
we
were
so
secret
he
offered
to
give
us
a
chance
of
talking
to
alone
and
so
we
came
right
away
round
to
his
rooms
at
once
you
have
heard
it
all
and
i
am
very
sorry
if
i
have
given
you
pain
and
i
hope
that
you
do
not
think
very
meanly
of
me
had
by
no
means
relaxed
his
rigid
attitude
but
had
listened
with
a
frowning
brow
and
a
compressed
lip
to
this
long
narrative
me
he
said
but
it
is
not
my
custom
to
discuss
my
most
intimate
personal
affairs
in
this
public
manner
you
won
t
forgive
me
won
t
shake
hands
before
i
go
certainly
if
it
would
give
you
any
pleasure
put
out
his
hand
and
coldly
grasped
that
which
she
extended
to
him
i
had
hoped
suggested
that
you
would
have
joined
us
in
a
friendly
supper
i
think
that
there
you
ask
a
little
too
much
responded
his
i
may
be
forced
to
acquiesce
in
these
recent
developments
but
i
can
hardly
be
expected
to
make
merry
over
them
i
think
that
with
your
permission
i
will
now
wish
you
all
a
very
good
night
included
us
all
in
a
sweeping
bow
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
i
trust
that
you
at
least
will
honour
me
with
your
company
said
is
always
a
joy
to
meet
an
for
i
am
one
of
those
who
believe
that
the
folly
of
a
monarch
and
the
blundering
of
a
minister
in
far
gone
years
will
not
prevent
our
children
from
being
some
day
citizens
of
the
same
world
wide
country
under
a
flag
which
shall
be
a
quartering
of
the
with
the
and
case
has
been
an
interesting
one
remarked
when
our
visitors
had
left
us
because
it
serves
to
show
very
clearly
how
simple
the
explanation
may
be
of
an
affair
which
at
first
sight
seems
to
be
almost
inexplicable
could
be
more
natural
than
the
sequence
of
events
as
narrated
by
this
lady
and
nothing
stranger
than
the
result
when
viewed
for
instance
by
of
were
not
yourself
at
fault
at
all
then
the
first
two
facts
were
very
obvious
to
me
the
one
that
the
lady
had
been
quite
willing
to
undergo
the
wedding
ceremony
the
other
that
she
had
repented
of
it
within
a
few
minutes
of
returning
home
something
had
occurred
during
the
morning
then
to
cause
her
to
change
her
mind
could
that
something
be
could
not
have
spoken
to
anyone
when
she
was
out
for
she
had
been
in
the
company
of
the
bridegroom
she
seen
someone
then
she
had
it
must
be
someone
from
because
she
had
spent
so
short
a
time
in
this
country
that
she
could
hardly
have
allowed
anyone
to
acquire
so
deep
an
influence
over
her
that
the
mere
sight
of
him
would
induce
her
to
change
her
plans
so
completely
see
we
have
already
arrived
by
a
process
of
exclusion
at
the
idea
that
she
might
have
seen
an
who
could
this
be
and
why
should
he
possess
so
much
influence
over
her
might
be
a
lover
it
might
be
a
husband
young
womanhood
had
i
knew
been
spent
in
rough
scenes
and
under
strange
conditions
far
i
had
got
before
i
ever
heard
s
narrative
he
told
us
of
a
man
in
a
pew
of
the
change
in
the
bride
s
manner
of
so
transparent
a
device
for
obtaining
a
note
as
the
dropping
of
a
bouquet
of
her
resort
to
her
confidential
maid
and
of
her
very
significant
allusion
to
claim
jumping
which
in
miners
parlance
means
taking
possession
of
that
which
another
person
has
a
prior
claim
to
the
whole
situation
became
absolutely
clear
had
gone
off
with
a
man
and
the
man
was
either
a
lover
or
was
a
previous
husband
the
chances
being
in
favour
of
the
latter
how
in
the
world
did
you
find
them
might
have
been
difficult
but
friend
held
information
in
his
hands
the
value
of
which
he
did
not
himself
know
initials
were
of
course
of
the
highest
importance
but
more
valuable
still
was
it
to
know
that
within
a
week
he
had
settled
his
bill
at
one
of
the
most
select
hotels
did
you
deduce
the
select
the
select
prices
shillings
for
a
bed
and
eightpence
for
a
glass
of
sherry
pointed
to
one
of
the
most
expensive
hotels
are
not
many
in
which
charge
at
that
rate
the
second
one
which
i
visited
in
i
learned
by
an
inspection
of
the
book
that
h
an
gentleman
had
left
only
the
day
before
and
on
looking
over
the
entries
against
him
i
came
upon
the
very
items
which
i
had
seen
in
the
duplicate
bill
letters
were
to
be
forwarded
to
so
thither
i
travelled
and
being
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
loving
couple
at
home
i
ventured
to
give
them
some
paternal
advice
and
to
point
out
to
them
that
it
would
be
better
in
every
way
that
they
should
make
their
position
a
little
clearer
both
to
the
general
public
and
to
in
particular
i
invited
them
to
meet
him
here
and
as
you
see
i
made
him
keep
the
appointment
with
no
very
good
result
i
remarked
conduct
was
certainly
not
very
gracious
said
smiling
perhaps
you
would
not
be
very
gracious
either
if
after
all
the
trouble
of
wooing
and
wedding
you
found
yourself
deprived
in
an
instant
of
wife
and
of
fortune
i
think
that
we
may
judge
very
mercifully
and
thank
our
stars
that
we
are
never
likely
to
find
ourselves
in
the
same
position
your
chair
up
and
hand
me
my
violin
for
the
only
problem
we
have
still
to
solve
is
how
to
while
away
these
bleak
autumnal
evenings
xi
the
adventure
of
the
beryl
coronet
said
i
as
i
stood
one
morning
in
our
bow
window
looking
down
the
street
here
is
a
madman
coming
along
seems
rather
sad
that
his
relatives
should
allow
him
to
come
out
alone
friend
rose
lazily
from
his
armchair
and
stood
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
dressing
gown
looking
over
my
shoulder
was
a
bright
crisp
morning
and
the
snow
of
the
day
before
still
lay
deep
upon
the
ground
shimmering
brightly
in
the
wintry
sun
the
centre
of
it
had
been
ploughed
into
a
brown
crumbly
band
by
the
traffic
but
at
either
side
and
on
the
heaped
up
edges
of
the
foot
paths
it
still
lay
as
white
as
when
it
fell
grey
pavement
had
been
cleaned
and
scraped
but
was
still
dangerously
slippery
so
that
there
were
fewer
passengers
than
usual
from
the
direction
of
the
no
one
was
coming
save
the
single
gentleman
whose
eccentric
conduct
had
drawn
my
attention
was
a
man
of
about
fifty
tall
portly
and
imposing
with
a
massive
strongly
marked
face
and
a
commanding
figure
was
dressed
in
a
sombre
yet
rich
style
in
black
frock
coat
shining
hat
neat
brown
gaiters
and
well
cut
pearl
grey
trousers
his
actions
were
in
absurd
contrast
to
the
dignity
of
his
dress
and
features
for
he
was
running
hard
with
occasional
little
springs
such
as
a
weary
man
gives
who
is
little
accustomed
to
set
any
tax
upon
his
legs
he
ran
he
jerked
his
hands
up
and
down
waggled
his
head
and
writhed
his
face
into
the
most
extraordinary
contortions
on
earth
can
be
the
matter
with
him
i
asked
is
looking
up
at
the
numbers
of
the
houses
i
believe
that
he
is
coming
here
said
rubbing
his
hands
i
rather
think
he
is
coming
to
consult
me
professionally
i
think
that
i
recognise
the
symptoms
did
i
not
tell
you
he
spoke
the
man
puffing
and
blowing
rushed
at
our
door
and
pulled
at
our
bell
until
the
whole
house
resounded
with
the
clanging
a
few
moments
later
he
was
in
our
room
still
puffing
still
gesticulating
but
with
so
fixed
a
look
of
grief
and
despair
in
his
eyes
that
our
smiles
were
turned
in
an
instant
to
horror
and
pity
a
while
he
could
not
get
his
words
out
but
swayed
his
body
and
plucked
at
his
hair
like
one
who
has
been
driven
to
the
extreme
limits
of
his
reason
suddenly
springing
to
his
feet
he
beat
his
head
against
the
wall
with
such
force
that
we
both
rushed
upon
him
and
tore
him
away
to
the
centre
of
the
room
pushed
him
down
into
the
easy
chair
and
sitting
beside
him
patted
his
hand
and
chatted
with
him
in
the
easy
soothing
tones
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
employ
have
come
to
me
to
tell
your
story
have
you
not
said
he
are
fatigued
with
your
haste
wait
until
you
have
recovered
yourself
and
then
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
look
into
any
little
problem
which
you
may
submit
to
me
man
sat
for
a
minute
or
more
with
a
heaving
chest
fighting
against
his
emotion
he
passed
his
handkerchief
over
his
brow
set
his
lips
tight
and
turned
his
face
towards
us
doubt
you
think
me
mad
said
he
i
see
that
you
have
had
some
great
trouble
responded
knows
i
have
a
trouble
which
is
enough
to
unseat
my
reason
so
sudden
and
so
terrible
is
it
disgrace
i
might
have
faced
although
i
am
a
man
whose
character
has
never
yet
borne
a
stain
affliction
also
is
the
lot
of
every
man
but
the
two
coming
together
and
in
so
frightful
a
form
have
been
enough
to
shake
my
very
soul
it
is
not
i
alone
very
noblest
in
the
land
may
suffer
unless
some
way
be
found
out
of
this
horrible
affair
compose
yourself
sir
said
and
let
me
have
a
clear
account
of
who
you
are
and
what
it
is
that
has
befallen
you
name
answered
our
visitor
is
probably
familiar
to
your
ears
i
am
of
the
banking
firm
of
of
name
was
indeed
well
known
to
us
as
belonging
to
the
senior
partner
in
the
second
largest
private
banking
concern
in
the
of
could
have
happened
then
to
bring
one
of
the
foremost
citizens
of
to
this
most
pitiable
pass
waited
all
curiosity
until
with
another
effort
he
braced
himself
to
tell
his
story
i
feel
that
time
is
of
value
said
he
that
is
why
i
hastened
here
when
the
police
inspector
suggested
that
i
should
secure
your
co
operation
i
came
to
by
the
and
hurried
from
there
on
foot
for
the
cabs
go
slowly
through
this
snow
is
why
i
was
so
out
of
breath
for
i
am
a
man
who
takes
very
little
exercise
i
feel
better
now
and
i
will
put
the
facts
before
you
as
shortly
and
yet
as
clearly
as
i
can
is
of
course
well
known
to
you
that
in
a
successful
banking
business
as
much
depends
upon
our
being
able
to
find
remunerative
investments
for
our
funds
as
upon
our
increasing
our
connection
and
the
number
of
our
depositors
of
our
most
lucrative
means
of
laying
out
money

in
the
shape
of
loans

the
security
is
unimpeachable

a
good
deal
in
this
direction
during
the
last
few
years
and
there
are
many
noble
families
to
whom
we
have
advanced
large
sums
upon
the
security
of
their
pictures
libraries
or
plate
morning
i
was
seated
in
my
office
at
the
bank
when
a
card
was
brought
in
to
me
by
one
of
the
clerks
i
started
when
i
saw
the
name
for
it
was
that
of
none
other
than
well
perhaps
even
to
you
i
had
better
say
no
more
than
that
it
was
a
name
which
is
a
household
word
all
over
the
earth
one
of
the
highest
noblest
most
exalted
names
in
i
was
overwhelmed
by
the
honour
and
attempted
when
he
entered
to
say
so
but
he
plunged
at
once
into
business
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
wishes
to
hurry
quickly
through
a
disagreeable
task
said
he
i
have
been
informed
that
you
are
in
the
habit
of
advancing
money
firm
does
so
when
the
security
is
good
i
answered
is
absolutely
essential
to
me
said
he
that
i
should
have
pounds
at
once
i
could
of
course
borrow
so
trifling
a
sum
ten
times
over
from
my
friends
but
i
much
prefer
to
make
it
a
matter
of
business
and
to
carry
out
that
business
myself
my
position
you
can
readily
understand
that
it
is
unwise
to
place
one
s
self
under
obligations
how
long
may
i
ask
do
you
want
this
sum
i
asked
i
have
a
large
sum
due
to
me
and
i
shall
then
most
certainly
repay
what
you
advance
with
whatever
interest
you
think
it
right
to
charge
it
is
very
essential
to
me
that
the
money
should
be
paid
at
once
i
should
be
happy
to
advance
it
without
further
parley
from
my
own
private
purse
said
i
were
it
not
that
the
strain
would
be
rather
more
than
it
could
bear
on
the
other
hand
i
am
to
do
it
in
the
name
of
the
firm
then
in
justice
to
my
partner
i
must
insist
that
even
in
your
case
every
businesslike
precaution
should
be
taken
i
should
much
prefer
to
have
it
so
said
he
raising
up
a
square
black
morocco
case
which
he
had
laid
beside
his
chair
have
doubtless
heard
of
the
of
the
most
precious
public
possessions
of
the
empire
said
i
opened
the
case
and
there
imbedded
in
soft
flesh
coloured
velvet
lay
the
magnificent
piece
of
jewellery
which
he
had
named
are
thirty
nine
enormous
beryls
said
he
and
the
price
of
the
gold
chasing
is
incalculable
lowest
estimate
would
put
the
worth
of
the
coronet
at
double
the
sum
which
i
have
asked
i
am
prepared
to
leave
it
with
you
as
my
security
i
took
the
precious
case
into
my
hands
and
looked
in
some
perplexity
from
it
to
my
illustrious
client
doubt
its
value
he
asked
at
all
i
only
doubt
propriety
of
my
leaving
it
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
about
that
i
should
not
dream
of
doing
so
were
it
not
absolutely
certain
that
i
should
be
able
in
four
days
to
reclaim
it
is
a
pure
matter
of
form
the
security
sufficient
understand
that
i
am
giving
you
a
strong
proof
of
the
confidence
which
i
have
in
you
founded
upon
all
that
i
have
heard
of
you
i
rely
upon
you
not
only
to
be
discreet
and
to
refrain
from
all
gossip
upon
the
matter
but
above
all
to
preserve
this
coronet
with
every
possible
precaution
because
i
need
not
say
that
a
great
public
scandal
would
be
caused
if
any
harm
were
to
befall
it
injury
to
it
would
be
almost
as
serious
as
its
complete
loss
for
there
are
no
beryls
in
the
world
to
match
these
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
replace
them
i
leave
it
with
you
however
with
every
confidence
and
i
shall
call
for
it
in
person
on
morning
that
my
client
was
anxious
to
leave
i
said
no
more
but
calling
for
my
cashier
i
ordered
him
to
pay
over
fifty
pound
notes
i
was
alone
once
more
however
with
the
precious
case
lying
upon
the
table
in
front
of
me
i
could
not
but
think
with
some
misgivings
of
the
immense
responsibility
which
it
entailed
upon
me
could
be
no
doubt
that
as
it
was
a
national
possession
a
horrible
scandal
would
ensue
if
any
misfortune
should
occur
to
it
i
already
regretted
having
ever
consented
to
take
charge
of
it
it
was
too
late
to
alter
the
matter
now
so
i
locked
it
up
in
my
private
safe
and
turned
once
more
to
my
work
evening
came
i
felt
that
it
would
be
an
imprudence
to
leave
so
precious
a
thing
in
the
office
behind
me
safes
had
been
forced
before
now
and
why
should
not
mine
be
so
how
terrible
would
be
the
position
in
which
i
should
find
myself
i
determined
therefore
that
for
the
next
few
days
i
would
always
carry
the
case
backward
and
forward
with
me
so
that
it
might
never
be
really
out
of
my
reach
this
intention
i
called
a
cab
and
drove
out
to
my
house
at
carrying
the
jewel
with
me
i
did
not
breathe
freely
until
i
had
taken
it
upstairs
and
locked
it
in
the
bureau
of
my
dressing
room
now
a
word
as
to
my
household
for
i
wish
you
to
thoroughly
understand
the
situation
groom
and
my
page
sleep
out
of
the
house
and
may
be
set
aside
altogether
i
have
three
maid
servants
who
have
been
with
me
a
number
of
years
and
whose
absolute
reliability
is
quite
above
suspicion
the
second
waiting
maid
has
only
been
in
my
service
a
few
months
came
with
an
excellent
character
however
and
has
always
given
me
satisfaction
is
a
very
pretty
girl
and
has
attracted
admirers
who
have
occasionally
hung
about
the
place
is
the
only
drawback
which
we
have
found
to
her
but
we
believe
her
to
be
a
thoroughly
good
girl
in
every
way
much
for
the
servants
family
itself
is
so
small
that
it
will
not
take
me
long
to
describe
it
i
am
a
widower
and
have
an
only
son
has
been
a
disappointment
to
me
a
grievous
disappointment
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
am
myself
to
blame
tell
me
that
i
have
spoiled
him
likely
i
have
my
dear
wife
died
i
felt
that
he
was
all
i
had
to
love
i
could
not
bear
to
see
the
smile
fade
even
for
a
moment
from
his
face
i
have
never
denied
him
a
wish
it
would
have
been
better
for
both
of
us
had
i
been
sterner
but
i
meant
it
for
the
best
was
naturally
my
intention
that
he
should
succeed
me
in
my
business
but
he
was
not
of
a
business
turn
was
wild
wayward
and
to
speak
the
truth
i
could
not
trust
him
in
the
handling
of
large
sums
of
money
he
was
young
he
became
a
member
of
an
aristocratic
club
and
there
having
charming
manners
he
was
soon
the
intimate
of
a
number
of
men
with
long
purses
and
expensive
habits
learned
to
play
heavily
at
cards
and
to
squander
money
on
the
turf
until
he
had
again
and
again
to
come
to
me
and
implore
me
to
give
him
an
advance
upon
his
allowance
that
he
might
settle
his
debts
of
honour
tried
more
than
once
to
break
away
from
the
dangerous
company
which
he
was
keeping
but
each
time
the
influence
of
his
friend
was
enough
to
draw
him
back
again
indeed
i
could
not
wonder
that
such
a
man
as
should
gain
an
influence
over
him
for
he
has
frequently
brought
him
to
my
house
and
i
have
found
myself
that
i
could
hardly
resist
the
fascination
of
his
manner
is
older
than
a
man
of
the
world
to
his
finger
tips
one
who
had
been
everywhere
seen
everything
a
brilliant
talker
and
a
man
of
great
personal
beauty
when
i
think
of
him
in
cold
blood
far
away
from
the
glamour
of
his
presence
i
am
convinced
from
his
cynical
speech
and
the
look
which
i
have
caught
in
his
eyes
that
he
is
one
who
should
be
deeply
distrusted
i
think
and
so
too
thinks
my
little
who
has
a
woman
s
quick
insight
into
character
now
there
is
only
she
to
be
described
is
my
niece
but
when
my
brother
died
five
years
ago
and
left
her
alone
in
the
world
i
adopted
her
and
have
looked
upon
her
ever
since
as
my
daughter
is
a
sunbeam
in
my
house
sweet
loving
beautiful
a
wonderful
manager
and
housekeeper
yet
as
tender
and
quiet
and
gentle
as
a
woman
could
be
is
my
right
hand
i
do
not
know
what
i
could
do
without
her
only
one
matter
has
she
ever
gone
against
my
wishes
my
boy
has
asked
her
to
marry
him
for
he
loves
her
devotedly
but
each
time
she
has
refused
him
i
think
that
if
anyone
could
have
drawn
him
into
the
right
path
it
would
have
been
she
and
that
his
marriage
might
have
changed
his
whole
life
but
now
alas
it
is
too
late
forever
too
late
you
know
the
people
who
live
under
my
roof
and
i
shall
continue
with
my
miserable
story
we
were
taking
coffee
in
the
drawing
room
that
night
after
dinner
i
told
and
my
experience
and
of
the
precious
treasure
which
we
had
under
our
roof
suppressing
only
the
name
of
my
client
who
had
brought
in
the
coffee
had
i
am
sure
left
the
room
but
i
cannot
swear
that
the
door
was
closed
and
were
much
interested
and
wished
to
see
the
famous
coronet
but
i
thought
it
better
not
to
disturb
it
have
you
put
it
asked
my
own
bureau
i
hope
to
goodness
the
house
won
t
be
burgled
during
the
night
said
he
is
locked
up
i
answered
any
old
key
will
fit
that
bureau
i
was
a
youngster
i
have
opened
it
myself
with
the
key
of
the
box
room
cupboard
often
had
a
wild
way
of
talking
so
that
i
thought
little
of
what
he
said
followed
me
to
my
room
however
that
night
with
a
very
grave
face
here
dad
said
he
with
his
eyes
cast
down
can
you
let
me
have
pounds
i
cannot
i
answered
sharply
i
have
been
far
too
generous
with
you
in
money
matters
have
been
very
kind
said
he
but
i
must
have
this
money
or
else
i
can
never
show
my
face
inside
the
club
again
a
very
good
thing
too
i
cried
but
you
would
not
have
me
leave
it
a
dishonoured
man
said
he
i
could
not
bear
the
disgrace
i
must
raise
the
money
in
some
way
and
if
you
will
not
let
me
have
it
then
i
must
try
other
means
i
was
very
angry
for
this
was
the
third
demand
during
the
month
shall
not
have
a
farthing
from
me
i
cried
on
which
he
bowed
and
left
the
room
without
another
word
he
was
gone
i
unlocked
my
bureau
made
sure
that
my
treasure
was
safe
and
locked
it
again
i
started
to
go
round
the
house
to
see
that
all
was
secure
a
duty
which
i
usually
leave
to
but
which
i
thought
it
well
to
perform
myself
that
night
i
came
down
the
stairs
i
saw
herself
at
the
side
window
of
the
hall
which
she
closed
and
fastened
as
i
approached
me
dad
said
she
looking
i
thought
a
little
disturbed
did
you
give
the
maid
leave
to
go
out
to
night
not
came
in
just
now
by
the
back
door
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
has
only
been
to
the
side
gate
to
see
someone
but
i
think
that
it
is
hardly
safe
and
should
be
stopped
must
speak
to
her
in
the
morning
or
i
will
if
you
prefer
it
you
sure
that
everything
is
fastened
sure
dad
good
night
i
kissed
her
and
went
up
to
my
bedroom
again
where
i
was
soon
asleep
i
am
endeavouring
to
tell
you
everything
which
may
have
any
bearing
upon
the
case
but
i
beg
that
you
will
question
me
upon
any
point
which
i
do
not
make
clear
the
contrary
your
statement
is
singularly
lucid
i
come
to
a
part
of
my
story
now
in
which
i
should
wish
to
be
particularly
so
i
am
not
a
very
heavy
sleeper
and
the
anxiety
in
my
mind
tended
no
doubt
to
make
me
even
less
so
than
usual
two
in
the
morning
then
i
was
awakened
by
some
sound
in
the
house
had
ceased
ere
i
was
wide
awake
but
it
had
left
an
impression
behind
it
as
though
a
window
had
gently
closed
somewhere
i
lay
listening
with
all
my
ears
to
my
horror
there
was
a
distinct
sound
of
footsteps
moving
softly
in
the
next
room
i
slipped
out
of
bed
all
palpitating
with
fear
and
peeped
round
the
corner
of
my
dressing
room
door
i
screamed
you
villain
you
thief
dare
you
touch
that
coronet
gas
was
half
up
as
i
had
left
it
and
my
unhappy
boy
dressed
only
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
was
standing
beside
the
light
holding
the
coronet
in
his
hands
appeared
to
be
wrenching
at
it
or
bending
it
with
all
his
strength
my
cry
he
dropped
it
from
his
grasp
and
turned
as
pale
as
death
i
snatched
it
up
and
examined
it
of
the
gold
corners
with
three
of
the
beryls
in
it
was
missing
blackguard
i
shouted
beside
myself
with
rage
have
destroyed
it
have
dishonoured
me
forever
are
the
jewels
which
you
have
stolen
he
cried
thief
i
roared
shaking
him
by
the
shoulder
are
none
missing
cannot
be
any
missing
said
he
are
three
missing
you
know
where
they
are
i
call
you
a
liar
as
well
as
a
thief
i
not
see
you
trying
to
tear
off
another
piece
have
called
me
names
enough
said
he
i
will
not
stand
it
any
longer
i
shall
not
say
another
word
about
this
business
since
you
have
chosen
to
insult
me
i
will
leave
your
house
in
the
morning
and
make
my
own
way
in
the
world
shall
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
the
police
i
cried
half
mad
with
grief
and
rage
i
shall
have
this
matter
probed
to
the
bottom
shall
learn
nothing
from
me
said
he
with
a
passion
such
as
i
should
not
have
thought
was
in
his
nature
you
choose
to
call
the
police
let
the
police
find
what
they
can
this
time
the
whole
house
was
astir
for
i
had
raised
my
voice
in
my
anger
was
the
first
to
rush
into
my
room
and
at
the
sight
of
the
coronet
and
of
s
face
she
read
the
whole
story
and
with
a
scream
fell
down
senseless
on
the
ground
i
sent
the
house
maid
for
the
police
and
put
the
investigation
into
their
hands
at
once
the
inspector
and
a
constable
entered
the
house
who
had
stood
sullenly
with
his
arms
folded
asked
me
whether
it
was
my
intention
to
charge
him
with
theft
i
answered
that
it
had
ceased
to
be
a
private
matter
but
had
become
a
public
one
since
the
ruined
coronet
was
national
property
i
was
determined
that
the
law
should
have
its
way
in
everything
least
said
he
you
will
not
have
me
arrested
at
once
would
be
to
your
advantage
as
well
as
mine
if
i
might
leave
the
house
for
five
minutes
you
may
get
away
or
perhaps
that
you
may
conceal
what
you
have
stolen
said
i
then
realising
the
dreadful
position
in
which
i
was
placed
i
implored
him
to
remember
that
not
only
my
honour
but
that
of
one
who
was
far
greater
than
i
was
at
stake
and
that
he
threatened
to
raise
a
scandal
which
would
convulse
the
nation
might
avert
it
all
if
he
would
but
tell
me
what
he
had
done
with
the
three
missing
stones
may
as
well
face
the
matter
said
i
you
have
been
caught
in
the
act
and
no
confession
could
make
your
guilt
more
heinous
you
but
make
such
reparation
as
is
in
your
power
by
telling
us
where
the
beryls
are
all
shall
be
forgiven
and
forgotten
your
forgiveness
for
those
who
ask
for
it
he
answered
turning
away
from
me
with
a
sneer
i
saw
that
he
was
too
hardened
for
any
words
of
mine
to
influence
him
was
but
one
way
for
it
i
called
in
the
inspector
and
gave
him
into
custody
a
search
was
made
at
once
not
only
of
his
person
but
of
his
room
and
of
every
portion
of
the
house
where
he
could
possibly
have
concealed
the
gems
but
no
trace
of
them
could
be
found
nor
would
the
wretched
boy
open
his
mouth
for
all
our
persuasions
and
our
threats
morning
he
was
removed
to
a
cell
and
i
after
going
through
all
the
police
formalities
have
hurried
round
to
you
to
implore
you
to
use
your
skill
in
unravelling
the
matter
police
have
openly
confessed
that
they
can
at
present
make
nothing
of
it
may
go
to
any
expense
which
you
think
necessary
i
have
already
offered
a
reward
of
pounds
what
shall
i
do
i
have
lost
my
honour
my
gems
and
my
son
in
one
night
what
shall
i
do
put
a
hand
on
either
side
of
his
head
and
rocked
himself
to
and
fro
droning
to
himself
like
a
child
whose
grief
has
got
beyond
words
sat
silent
for
some
few
minutes
with
his
brows
knitted
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire
you
receive
much
company
he
asked
save
my
partner
with
his
family
and
an
occasional
friend
of
s
has
been
several
times
lately
one
else
i
think
you
go
out
much
in
society
does
and
i
stay
at
home
neither
of
us
care
for
it
is
unusual
in
a
young
girl
is
of
a
quiet
nature
she
is
not
so
very
young
is
four
and
twenty
matter
from
what
you
say
seems
to
have
been
a
shock
to
her
also
is
even
more
affected
than
i
have
neither
of
you
any
doubt
as
to
your
son
s
guilt
can
we
have
when
i
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
with
the
coronet
in
his
hands
i
hardly
consider
that
a
conclusive
proof
the
remainder
of
the
coronet
at
all
injured
it
was
twisted
you
not
think
then
that
he
might
have
been
trying
to
straighten
it
bless
you
are
doing
what
you
can
for
him
and
for
me
it
is
too
heavy
a
task
was
he
doing
there
at
all
his
purpose
were
innocent
why
did
he
not
say
so
if
it
were
guilty
why
did
he
not
invent
a
lie
silence
appears
to
me
to
cut
both
ways
are
several
singular
points
about
the
case
did
the
police
think
of
the
noise
which
awoke
you
from
your
sleep
considered
that
it
might
be
caused
by
s
closing
his
bedroom
door
a
likely
story
if
a
man
bent
on
felony
would
slam
his
door
so
as
to
wake
a
household
did
they
say
then
of
the
disappearance
of
these
gems
are
still
sounding
the
planking
and
probing
the
furniture
in
the
hope
of
finding
them
they
thought
of
looking
outside
the
house
they
have
shown
extraordinary
energy
whole
garden
has
already
been
minutely
examined
my
dear
sir
said
is
it
not
obvious
to
you
now
that
this
matter
really
strikes
very
much
deeper
than
either
you
or
the
police
were
at
first
inclined
to
think
appeared
to
you
to
be
a
simple
case
to
me
it
seems
exceedingly
complex
what
is
involved
by
your
theory
suppose
that
your
son
came
down
from
his
bed
went
at
great
risk
to
your
dressing
room
opened
your
bureau
took
out
your
coronet
broke
off
by
main
force
a
small
portion
of
it
went
off
to
some
other
place
concealed
three
gems
out
of
the
thirty
nine
with
such
skill
that
nobody
can
find
them
and
then
returned
with
the
other
thirty
six
into
the
room
in
which
he
exposed
himself
to
the
greatest
danger
of
being
discovered
i
ask
you
now
is
such
a
theory
tenable
what
other
is
there
cried
the
banker
with
a
gesture
of
despair
his
motives
were
innocent
why
does
he
not
explain
them
is
our
task
to
find
that
out
replied
so
now
if
you
please
we
will
set
off
for
together
and
devote
an
hour
to
glancing
a
little
more
closely
into
details
friend
insisted
upon
my
accompanying
them
in
their
expedition
which
i
was
eager
enough
to
do
for
my
curiosity
and
sympathy
were
deeply
stirred
by
the
story
to
which
we
had
listened
i
confess
that
the
guilt
of
the
banker
s
son
appeared
to
me
to
be
as
obvious
as
it
did
to
his
unhappy
father
but
still
i
had
such
faith
in
judgment
that
i
felt
that
there
must
be
some
grounds
for
hope
as
long
as
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
accepted
explanation
hardly
spoke
a
word
the
whole
way
out
to
the
southern
suburb
but
sat
with
his
chin
upon
his
breast
and
his
hat
drawn
over
his
eyes
sunk
in
the
deepest
thought
client
appeared
to
have
taken
fresh
heart
at
the
little
glimpse
of
hope
which
had
been
presented
to
him
and
he
even
broke
into
a
desultory
chat
with
me
over
his
business
affairs
a
short
railway
journey
and
a
shorter
walk
brought
us
to
the
modest
residence
of
the
great
financier
was
a
good
sized
square
house
of
white
stone
standing
back
a
little
from
the
road
a
double
carriage
sweep
with
a
snow
clad
lawn
stretched
down
in
front
to
two
large
iron
gates
which
closed
the
entrance
the
right
side
was
a
small
wooden
thicket
which
led
into
a
narrow
path
between
two
neat
hedges
stretching
from
the
road
to
the
kitchen
door
and
forming
the
tradesmen
s
entrance
the
left
ran
a
lane
which
led
to
the
stables
and
was
not
itself
within
the
grounds
at
all
being
a
public
though
little
used
thoroughfare
left
us
standing
at
the
door
and
walked
slowly
all
round
the
house
across
the
front
down
the
tradesmen
s
path
and
so
round
by
the
garden
behind
into
the
stable
lane
long
was
he
that
and
i
went
into
the
dining
room
and
waited
by
the
fire
until
he
should
return
were
sitting
there
in
silence
when
the
door
opened
and
a
young
lady
came
in
was
rather
above
the
middle
height
slim
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
which
seemed
the
darker
against
the
absolute
pallor
of
her
skin
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
ever
seen
such
deadly
paleness
in
a
woman
s
face
lips
too
were
bloodless
but
her
eyes
were
flushed
with
crying
she
swept
silently
into
the
room
she
impressed
me
with
a
greater
sense
of
grief
than
the
banker
had
done
in
the
morning
and
it
was
the
more
striking
in
her
as
she
was
evidently
a
woman
of
strong
character
with
immense
capacity
for
self
restraint
my
presence
she
went
straight
to
her
uncle
and
passed
her
hand
over
his
head
with
a
sweet
womanly
caress
have
given
orders
that
should
be
liberated
have
you
not
dad
she
asked
no
my
girl
the
matter
must
be
probed
to
the
bottom
i
am
so
sure
that
he
is
innocent
know
what
woman
s
instincts
are
i
know
that
he
has
done
no
harm
and
that
you
will
be
sorry
for
having
acted
so
harshly
is
he
silent
then
if
he
is
innocent
knows
because
he
was
so
angry
that
you
should
suspect
him
could
i
help
suspecting
him
when
i
actually
saw
him
with
the
coronet
in
his
hand
but
he
had
only
picked
it
up
to
look
at
it
do
do
take
my
word
for
it
that
he
is
innocent
the
matter
drop
and
say
no
more
is
so
dreadful
to
think
of
our
dear
in
prison
i
shall
never
let
it
drop
until
the
gems
are
found
never
affection
for
blinds
you
as
to
the
awful
consequences
to
me
from
hushing
the
thing
up
i
have
brought
a
gentleman
down
from
to
inquire
more
deeply
into
it
gentleman
she
asked
facing
round
to
me
his
friend
wished
us
to
leave
him
alone
is
round
in
the
stable
lane
now
stable
lane
raised
her
dark
eyebrows
can
he
hope
to
find
there
this
i
suppose
is
he
i
trust
sir
that
you
will
succeed
in
proving
what
i
feel
sure
is
the
truth
that
my
cousin
is
innocent
of
this
crime
i
fully
share
your
opinion
and
i
trust
with
you
that
we
may
prove
it
returned
going
back
to
the
mat
to
knock
the
snow
from
his
shoes
i
believe
i
have
the
honour
of
addressing
i
ask
you
a
question
or
two
do
sir
if
it
may
help
to
clear
this
horrible
affair
up
heard
nothing
yourself
last
night
until
my
uncle
here
began
to
speak
loudly
i
heard
that
and
i
came
down
shut
up
the
windows
and
doors
the
night
before
you
fasten
all
the
windows
they
all
fastened
this
morning
have
a
maid
who
has
a
sweetheart
i
think
that
you
remarked
to
your
uncle
last
night
that
she
had
been
out
to
see
him
and
she
was
the
girl
who
waited
in
the
drawing
room
and
who
may
have
heard
uncle
s
remarks
about
the
coronet
i
see
infer
that
she
may
have
gone
out
to
tell
her
sweetheart
and
that
the
two
may
have
planned
the
robbery
what
is
the
good
of
all
these
vague
theories
cried
the
banker
impatiently
when
i
have
told
you
that
i
saw
with
the
coronet
in
his
hands
a
little
must
come
back
to
that
this
girl
saw
her
return
by
the
kitchen
door
i
presume
when
i
went
to
see
if
the
door
was
fastened
for
the
night
i
met
her
slipping
in
i
saw
the
man
too
in
the
gloom
you
know
him
yes
he
is
the
green
grocer
who
brings
our
vegetables
round
name
is
stood
said
to
the
left
of
the
door
that
is
to
say
farther
up
the
path
than
is
necessary
to
reach
the
door
he
did
he
is
a
man
with
a
wooden
leg
like
fear
sprang
up
in
the
young
lady
s
expressive
black
eyes
you
are
like
a
magician
said
she
do
you
know
that
smiled
but
there
was
no
answering
smile
in
thin
eager
face
i
should
be
very
glad
now
to
go
upstairs
said
he
i
shall
probably
wish
to
go
over
the
outside
of
the
house
again
i
had
better
take
a
look
at
the
lower
windows
before
i
go
up
walked
swiftly
round
from
one
to
the
other
pausing
only
at
the
large
one
which
looked
from
the
hall
onto
the
stable
lane
he
opened
and
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
sill
with
his
powerful
magnifying
lens
we
shall
go
upstairs
said
he
at
last
banker
s
dressing
room
was
a
plainly
furnished
little
chamber
with
a
grey
carpet
a
large
bureau
and
a
long
mirror
went
to
the
bureau
first
and
looked
hard
at
the
lock
key
was
used
to
open
it
he
asked
which
my
son
himself
indicated
that
of
the
cupboard
of
the
lumber
room
you
it
here
is
it
on
the
dressing
table
took
it
up
and
opened
the
bureau
is
a
noiseless
lock
said
he
is
no
wonder
that
it
did
not
wake
you
case
i
presume
contains
the
coronet
must
have
a
look
at
it
opened
the
case
and
taking
out
the
diadem
he
laid
it
upon
the
table
was
a
magnificent
specimen
of
the
jeweller
s
art
and
the
thirty
six
stones
were
the
finest
that
i
have
ever
seen
one
side
of
the
coronet
was
a
cracked
edge
where
a
corner
holding
three
gems
had
been
torn
away
said
here
is
the
corner
which
corresponds
to
that
which
has
been
so
unfortunately
lost
i
beg
that
you
will
break
it
off
banker
recoiled
in
horror
i
should
not
dream
of
trying
said
he
i
will
suddenly
bent
his
strength
upon
it
but
without
result
i
feel
it
give
a
little
said
he
but
though
i
am
exceptionally
strong
in
the
fingers
it
would
take
me
all
my
time
to
break
it
ordinary
man
could
not
do
it
what
do
you
think
would
happen
if
i
did
break
it
would
be
a
noise
like
a
pistol
shot
you
tell
me
that
all
this
happened
within
a
few
yards
of
your
bed
and
that
you
heard
nothing
of
it
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
is
all
dark
to
me
perhaps
it
may
grow
lighter
as
we
go
do
you
think
i
confess
that
i
still
share
my
uncle
s
perplexity
son
had
no
shoes
or
slippers
on
when
you
saw
him
had
nothing
on
save
only
his
trousers
and
shirt
you
have
certainly
been
favoured
with
extraordinary
luck
during
this
inquiry
and
it
will
be
entirely
our
own
fault
if
we
do
not
succeed
in
clearing
the
matter
up
your
permission
i
shall
now
continue
my
investigations
outside
went
alone
at
his
own
request
for
he
explained
that
any
unnecessary
footmarks
might
make
his
task
more
difficult
an
hour
or
more
he
was
at
work
returning
at
last
with
his
feet
heavy
with
snow
and
his
features
as
inscrutable
as
ever
i
think
that
i
have
seen
now
all
that
there
is
to
see
said
he
i
can
serve
you
best
by
returning
to
my
rooms
the
gems
are
they
i
cannot
tell
banker
wrung
his
hands
i
shall
never
see
them
again
he
cried
my
son
give
me
hopes
opinion
is
in
no
way
altered
for
s
sake
what
was
this
dark
business
which
was
acted
in
my
house
last
night
you
can
call
upon
me
at
my
rooms
to
morrow
morning
between
nine
and
ten
i
shall
be
happy
to
do
what
i
can
to
make
it
clearer
i
understand
that
you
give
me
carte
blanche
to
act
for
you
provided
only
that
i
get
back
the
gems
and
that
you
place
no
limit
on
the
sum
i
may
draw
i
would
give
my
fortune
to
have
them
back
good
i
shall
look
into
the
matter
between
this
and
then
bye
it
is
just
possible
that
i
may
have
to
come
over
here
again
before
evening
was
obvious
to
me
that
my
companion
s
mind
was
now
made
up
about
the
case
although
what
his
conclusions
were
was
more
than
i
could
even
dimly
imagine
times
during
our
homeward
journey
i
endeavoured
to
sound
him
upon
the
point
but
he
always
glided
away
to
some
other
topic
until
at
last
i
gave
it
over
in
despair
was
not
yet
three
when
we
found
ourselves
in
our
rooms
once
more
hurried
to
his
chamber
and
was
down
again
in
a
few
minutes
dressed
as
a
common
loafer
his
collar
turned
up
his
shiny
seedy
coat
his
red
cravat
and
his
worn
boots
he
was
a
perfect
sample
of
the
class
i
think
that
this
should
do
said
he
glancing
into
the
glass
above
the
fireplace
i
only
wish
that
you
could
come
with
me
but
i
fear
that
it
won
t
do
i
may
be
on
the
trail
in
this
matter
or
i
may
be
following
a
will
o
the
wisp
but
i
shall
soon
know
which
it
is
i
hope
that
i
may
be
back
in
a
few
hours
cut
a
slice
of
beef
from
the
joint
upon
the
sideboard
sandwiched
it
between
two
rounds
of
bread
and
thrusting
this
rude
meal
into
his
pocket
he
started
off
upon
his
expedition
i
had
just
finished
my
tea
when
he
returned
evidently
in
excellent
spirits
swinging
an
old
elastic
sided
boot
in
his
hand
chucked
it
down
into
a
corner
and
helped
himself
to
a
cup
of
tea
i
only
looked
in
as
i
passed
said
he
i
am
going
right
on
to
to
the
other
side
of
the
may
be
some
time
before
i
get
back
t
wait
up
for
me
in
case
i
should
be
late
are
you
getting
on
so
so
to
complain
of
i
have
been
out
to
since
i
saw
you
last
but
i
did
not
call
at
the
house
is
a
very
sweet
little
problem
and
i
would
not
have
missed
it
for
a
good
deal
i
must
not
sit
gossiping
here
but
must
get
these
disreputable
clothes
off
and
return
to
my
highly
respectable
self
i
could
see
by
his
manner
that
he
had
stronger
reasons
for
satisfaction
than
his
words
alone
would
imply
eyes
twinkled
and
there
was
even
a
touch
of
colour
upon
his
sallow
cheeks
hastened
upstairs
and
a
few
minutes
later
i
heard
the
slam
of
the
hall
door
which
told
me
that
he
was
off
once
more
upon
his
congenial
hunt
i
waited
until
midnight
but
there
was
no
sign
of
his
return
so
i
retired
to
my
room
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
him
to
be
away
for
days
and
nights
on
end
when
he
was
hot
upon
a
scent
so
that
his
lateness
caused
me
no
surprise
i
do
not
know
at
what
hour
he
came
in
but
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
there
he
was
with
a
cup
of
coffee
in
one
hand
and
the
paper
in
the
other
as
fresh
and
trim
as
possible
will
excuse
my
beginning
without
you
said
he
but
you
remember
that
our
client
has
rather
an
early
appointment
this
morning
it
is
after
nine
now
i
answered
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
that
were
he
i
thought
i
heard
a
ring
was
indeed
our
friend
the
financier
i
was
shocked
by
the
change
which
had
come
over
him
for
his
face
which
was
naturally
of
a
broad
and
massive
mould
was
now
pinched
and
fallen
in
while
his
hair
seemed
to
me
at
least
a
shade
whiter
entered
with
a
weariness
and
lethargy
which
was
even
more
painful
than
his
violence
of
the
morning
before
and
he
dropped
heavily
into
the
armchair
which
i
pushed
forward
for
him
i
do
not
know
what
i
have
done
to
be
so
severely
tried
said
he
two
days
ago
i
was
a
happy
and
prosperous
man
without
a
care
in
the
world
i
am
left
to
a
lonely
and
dishonoured
age
sorrow
comes
close
upon
the
heels
of
another
niece
has
deserted
me
you
bed
this
morning
had
not
been
slept
in
her
room
was
empty
and
a
note
for
me
lay
upon
the
hall
table
i
had
said
to
her
last
night
in
sorrow
and
not
in
anger
that
if
she
had
married
my
boy
all
might
have
been
well
with
him
it
was
thoughtless
of
me
to
say
so
is
to
that
remark
that
she
refers
in
this
note
my
dearest
uncle
i
feel
that
i
have
brought
trouble
upon
you
and
that
if
i
had
acted
differently
this
terrible
misfortune
might
never
have
occurred
i
cannot
with
this
thought
in
my
mind
ever
again
be
happy
under
your
roof
and
i
feel
that
i
must
leave
you
forever
not
worry
about
my
future
for
that
is
provided
for
and
above
all
do
not
search
for
me
for
it
will
be
fruitless
labour
and
an
ill
service
to
me
life
or
in
death
i
am
ever
your
loving
mary
could
she
mean
by
that
note
you
think
it
points
to
suicide
no
nothing
of
the
kind
is
perhaps
the
best
possible
solution
i
trust
that
you
are
nearing
the
end
of
your
troubles
say
so
have
heard
something
you
have
learned
something
are
the
gems
would
not
think
pounds
apiece
an
excessive
sum
for
them
i
would
pay
ten
would
be
unnecessary
thousand
will
cover
the
matter
there
is
a
little
reward
i
fancy
you
your
check
book
is
a
pen
make
it
out
for
pounds
a
dazed
face
the
banker
made
out
the
required
check
walked
over
to
his
desk
took
out
a
little
triangular
piece
of
gold
with
three
gems
in
it
and
threw
it
down
upon
the
table
a
shriek
of
joy
our
client
clutched
it
up
have
it
he
gasped
i
am
saved
i
am
saved
reaction
of
joy
was
as
passionate
as
his
grief
had
been
and
he
hugged
his
recovered
gems
to
his
bosom
is
one
other
thing
you
owe
said
rather
sternly
caught
up
a
pen
the
sum
and
i
will
pay
it
the
debt
is
not
to
me
owe
a
very
humble
apology
to
that
noble
lad
your
son
who
has
carried
himself
in
this
matter
as
i
should
be
proud
to
see
my
own
son
do
should
i
ever
chance
to
have
one
it
was
not
who
took
them
i
told
you
yesterday
and
i
repeat
to
day
that
it
was
not
are
sure
of
it
let
us
hurry
to
him
at
once
to
let
him
know
that
the
truth
is
known
knows
it
already
i
had
cleared
it
all
up
i
had
an
interview
with
him
and
finding
that
he
would
not
tell
me
the
story
i
told
it
to
him
on
which
he
had
to
confess
that
i
was
right
and
to
add
the
very
few
details
which
were
not
yet
quite
clear
to
me
news
of
this
morning
however
may
open
his
lips
heaven
s
sake
tell
me
then
what
is
this
extraordinary
mystery
i
will
do
so
and
i
will
show
you
the
steps
by
which
i
reached
it
let
me
say
to
you
first
that
which
it
is
hardest
for
me
to
say
and
for
you
to
hear
there
has
been
an
understanding
between
and
your
niece
have
now
fled
together
is
unfortunately
more
than
possible
it
is
certain
you
nor
your
son
knew
the
true
character
of
this
man
when
you
admitted
him
into
your
family
circle
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
a
ruined
gambler
an
absolutely
desperate
villain
a
man
without
heart
or
conscience
niece
knew
nothing
of
such
men
he
breathed
his
vows
to
her
as
he
had
done
to
a
hundred
before
her
she
flattered
herself
that
she
alone
had
touched
his
heart
devil
knows
best
what
he
said
but
at
least
she
became
his
tool
and
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
him
nearly
every
evening
i
cannot
and
i
will
not
believe
it
cried
the
banker
with
an
ashen
face
i
will
tell
you
then
what
occurred
in
your
house
last
night
niece
when
you
had
as
she
thought
gone
to
your
room
slipped
down
and
talked
to
her
lover
through
the
window
which
leads
into
the
stable
lane
footmarks
had
pressed
right
through
the
snow
so
long
had
he
stood
there
told
him
of
the
coronet
wicked
lust
for
gold
kindled
at
the
news
and
he
bent
her
to
his
will
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
loved
you
but
there
are
women
in
whom
the
love
of
a
lover
extinguishes
all
other
loves
and
i
think
that
she
must
have
been
one
had
hardly
listened
to
his
instructions
when
she
saw
you
coming
downstairs
on
which
she
closed
the
window
rapidly
and
told
you
about
one
of
the
servants
escapade
with
her
wooden
legged
lover
which
was
all
perfectly
true
boy
went
to
bed
after
his
interview
with
you
but
he
slept
badly
on
account
of
his
uneasiness
about
his
club
debts
the
middle
of
the
night
he
heard
a
soft
tread
pass
his
door
so
he
rose
and
looking
out
was
surprised
to
see
his
cousin
walking
very
stealthily
along
the
passage
until
she
disappeared
into
your
dressing
room
with
astonishment
the
lad
slipped
on
some
clothes
and
waited
there
in
the
dark
to
see
what
would
come
of
this
strange
affair
she
emerged
from
the
room
again
and
in
the
light
of
the
passage
lamp
your
son
saw
that
she
carried
the
precious
coronet
in
her
hands
passed
down
the
stairs
and
he
thrilling
with
horror
ran
along
and
slipped
behind
the
curtain
near
your
door
whence
he
could
see
what
passed
in
the
hall
beneath
saw
her
stealthily
open
the
window
hand
out
the
coronet
to
someone
in
the
gloom
and
then
closing
it
once
more
hurry
back
to
her
room
passing
quite
close
to
where
he
stood
hid
behind
the
curtain
long
as
she
was
on
the
scene
he
could
not
take
any
action
without
a
horrible
exposure
of
the
woman
whom
he
loved
the
instant
that
she
was
gone
he
realised
how
crushing
a
misfortune
this
would
be
for
you
and
how
all
important
it
was
to
set
it
right
rushed
down
just
as
he
was
in
his
bare
feet
opened
the
window
sprang
out
into
the
snow
and
ran
down
the
lane
where
he
could
see
a
dark
figure
in
the
moonlight
tried
to
get
away
but
caught
him
and
there
was
a
struggle
between
them
your
lad
tugging
at
one
side
of
the
coronet
and
his
opponent
at
the
other
the
scuffle
your
son
struck
and
cut
him
over
the
eye
something
suddenly
snapped
and
your
son
finding
that
he
had
the
coronet
in
his
hands
rushed
back
closed
the
window
ascended
to
your
room
and
had
just
observed
that
the
coronet
had
been
twisted
in
the
struggle
and
was
endeavouring
to
straighten
it
when
you
appeared
upon
the
scene
it
possible
gasped
the
banker
then
roused
his
anger
by
calling
him
names
at
a
moment
when
he
felt
that
he
had
deserved
your
warmest
thanks
could
not
explain
the
true
state
of
affairs
without
betraying
one
who
certainly
deserved
little
enough
consideration
at
his
hands
took
the
more
chivalrous
view
however
and
preserved
her
secret
that
was
why
she
shrieked
and
fainted
when
she
saw
the
coronet
cried
my
what
a
blind
fool
i
have
been
his
asking
to
be
allowed
to
go
out
for
five
minutes
dear
fellow
wanted
to
see
if
the
missing
piece
were
at
the
scene
of
the
struggle
cruelly
i
have
misjudged
him
i
arrived
at
the
house
continued
i
at
once
went
very
carefully
round
it
to
observe
if
there
were
any
traces
in
the
snow
which
might
help
me
i
knew
that
none
had
fallen
since
the
evening
before
and
also
that
there
had
been
a
strong
frost
to
preserve
impressions
i
passed
along
the
tradesmen
s
path
but
found
it
all
trampled
down
and
indistinguishable
beyond
it
however
at
the
far
side
of
the
kitchen
door
a
woman
had
stood
and
talked
with
a
man
whose
round
impressions
on
one
side
showed
that
he
had
a
wooden
leg
i
could
even
tell
that
they
had
been
disturbed
for
the
woman
had
run
back
swiftly
to
the
door
as
was
shown
by
the
deep
toe
and
light
heel
marks
while
leg
had
waited
a
little
and
then
had
gone
away
i
thought
at
the
time
that
this
might
be
the
maid
and
her
sweetheart
of
whom
you
had
already
spoken
to
me
and
inquiry
showed
it
was
so
i
passed
round
the
garden
without
seeing
anything
more
than
random
tracks
which
i
took
to
be
the
police
but
when
i
got
into
the
stable
lane
a
very
long
and
complex
story
was
written
in
the
snow
in
front
of
me
was
a
double
line
of
tracks
of
a
booted
man
and
a
second
double
line
which
i
saw
with
delight
belonged
to
a
man
with
naked
feet
i
was
at
once
convinced
from
what
you
had
told
me
that
the
latter
was
your
son
first
had
walked
both
ways
but
the
other
had
run
swiftly
and
as
his
tread
was
marked
in
places
over
the
depression
of
the
boot
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
passed
after
the
other
i
followed
them
up
and
found
they
led
to
the
hall
window
where
had
worn
all
the
snow
away
while
waiting
i
walked
to
the
other
end
which
was
a
hundred
yards
or
more
down
the
lane
i
saw
where
had
faced
round
where
the
snow
was
cut
up
as
though
there
had
been
a
struggle
and
finally
where
a
few
drops
of
blood
had
fallen
to
show
me
that
i
was
not
mistaken
had
then
run
down
the
lane
and
another
little
smudge
of
blood
showed
that
it
was
he
who
had
been
hurt
he
came
to
the
highroad
at
the
other
end
i
found
that
the
pavement
had
been
cleared
so
there
was
an
end
to
that
clue
entering
the
house
however
i
examined
as
you
remember
the
sill
and
framework
of
the
hall
window
with
my
lens
and
i
could
at
once
see
that
someone
had
passed
out
i
could
distinguish
the
outline
of
an
instep
where
the
wet
foot
had
been
placed
in
coming
in
i
was
then
beginning
to
be
able
to
form
an
opinion
as
to
what
had
occurred
a
man
had
waited
outside
the
window
someone
had
brought
the
gems
the
deed
had
been
overseen
by
your
son
he
had
pursued
the
thief
had
struggled
with
him
they
had
each
tugged
at
the
coronet
their
united
strength
causing
injuries
which
neither
alone
could
have
effected
had
returned
with
the
prize
but
had
left
a
fragment
in
the
grasp
of
his
opponent
far
i
was
clear
question
now
was
who
was
the
man
and
who
was
it
brought
him
the
coronet
is
an
old
maxim
of
mine
that
when
you
have
excluded
the
impossible
whatever
remains
however
improbable
must
be
the
truth
i
knew
that
it
was
not
you
who
had
brought
it
down
so
there
only
remained
your
niece
and
the
maids
if
it
were
the
maids
why
should
your
son
allow
himself
to
be
accused
in
their
place
could
be
no
possible
reason
he
loved
his
cousin
however
there
was
an
excellent
explanation
why
he
should
retain
her
secret
the
more
so
as
the
secret
was
a
disgraceful
one
i
remembered
that
you
had
seen
her
at
that
window
and
how
she
had
fainted
on
seeing
the
coronet
again
my
conjecture
became
a
certainty
who
could
it
be
who
was
her
confederate
a
lover
evidently
for
who
else
could
outweigh
the
love
and
gratitude
which
she
must
feel
to
you
i
knew
that
you
went
out
little
and
that
your
circle
of
friends
was
a
very
limited
one
among
them
was
i
had
heard
of
him
before
as
being
a
man
of
evil
reputation
among
women
must
have
been
he
who
wore
those
boots
and
retained
the
missing
gems
though
he
knew
that
had
discovered
him
he
might
still
flatter
himself
that
he
was
safe
for
the
lad
could
not
say
a
word
without
compromising
his
own
family
your
own
good
sense
will
suggest
what
measures
i
took
next
i
went
in
the
shape
of
a
loafer
to
s
house
managed
to
pick
up
an
acquaintance
with
his
valet
learned
that
his
master
had
cut
his
head
the
night
before
and
finally
at
the
expense
of
six
shillings
made
all
sure
by
buying
a
pair
of
his
cast
off
shoes
these
i
journeyed
down
to
and
saw
that
they
exactly
fitted
the
tracks
i
saw
an
ill
dressed
vagabond
in
the
lane
yesterday
evening
said
was
i
i
found
that
i
had
my
man
so
i
came
home
and
changed
my
clothes
was
a
delicate
part
which
i
had
to
play
then
for
i
saw
that
a
prosecution
must
be
avoided
to
avert
scandal
and
i
knew
that
so
astute
a
villain
would
see
that
our
hands
were
tied
in
the
matter
i
went
and
saw
him
first
of
course
he
denied
everything
when
i
gave
him
every
particular
that
had
occurred
he
tried
to
bluster
and
took
down
a
life
preserver
from
the
wall
i
knew
my
man
however
and
i
clapped
a
pistol
to
his
head
before
he
could
strike
he
became
a
little
more
reasonable
i
told
him
that
we
would
give
him
a
price
for
the
stones
he
held
pounds
apiece
brought
out
the
first
signs
of
grief
that
he
had
shown
dash
it
all
said
he
i
ve
let
them
go
at
six
hundred
for
the
three
i
soon
managed
to
get
the
address
of
the
receiver
who
had
them
on
promising
him
that
there
would
be
no
prosecution
i
set
to
him
and
after
much
chaffering
i
got
our
stones
at
pounds
apiece
i
looked
in
upon
your
son
told
him
that
all
was
right
and
eventually
got
to
my
bed
about
two
o
clock
after
what
i
may
call
a
really
hard
day
s
work
a
day
which
has
saved
from
a
great
public
scandal
said
the
banker
rising
i
cannot
find
words
to
thank
you
but
you
shall
not
find
me
ungrateful
for
what
you
have
done
skill
has
indeed
exceeded
all
that
i
have
heard
of
it
now
i
must
fly
to
my
dear
boy
to
apologise
to
him
for
the
wrong
which
i
have
done
him
to
what
you
tell
me
of
poor
it
goes
to
my
very
heart
even
your
skill
can
inform
me
where
she
is
now
i
think
that
we
may
safely
say
returned
that
she
is
wherever
is
is
equally
certain
too
that
whatever
her
sins
are
they
will
soon
receive
a
more
than
sufficient
punishment

the
adventure
of
the
copper
beeches
the
man
who
loves
art
for
its
own
sake
remarked
tossing
aside
the
advertisement
sheet
of
the
it
is
frequently
in
its
least
important
and
lowliest
manifestations
that
the
keenest
pleasure
is
to
be
derived
is
pleasant
to
me
to
observe
that
you
have
so
far
grasped
this
truth
that
in
these
little
records
of
our
cases
which
you
have
been
good
enough
to
draw
up
and
i
am
bound
to
say
occasionally
to
embellish
you
have
given
prominence
not
so
much
to
the
many
causes
c
l
bres
and
sensational
trials
in
which
i
have
figured
but
rather
to
those
incidents
which
may
have
been
trivial
in
themselves
but
which
have
given
room
for
those
faculties
of
deduction
and
of
logical
synthesis
which
i
have
made
my
special
province
yet
said
i
smiling
i
cannot
quite
hold
myself
absolved
from
the
charge
of
sensationalism
which
has
been
urged
against
my
records
have
erred
perhaps
he
observed
taking
up
a
glowing
cinder
with
the
tongs
and
lighting
with
it
the
long
cherry
wood
pipe
which
was
wont
to
replace
his
clay
when
he
was
in
a
disputatious
rather
than
a
meditative
mood
you
have
erred
perhaps
in
attempting
to
put
colour
and
life
into
each
of
your
statements
instead
of
confining
yourself
to
the
task
of
placing
upon
record
that
severe
reasoning
from
cause
to
effect
which
is
really
the
only
notable
feature
about
the
thing
seems
to
me
that
i
have
done
you
full
justice
in
the
matter
i
remarked
with
some
coldness
for
i
was
repelled
by
the
egotism
which
i
had
more
than
once
observed
to
be
a
strong
factor
in
my
friend
s
singular
character
it
is
not
selfishness
or
conceit
said
he
answering
as
was
his
wont
my
thoughts
rather
than
my
words
i
claim
full
justice
for
my
art
it
is
because
it
is
an
impersonal
thing
a
thing
beyond
myself
is
common
is
rare
it
is
upon
the
logic
rather
than
upon
the
crime
that
you
should
dwell
have
degraded
what
should
have
been
a
course
of
lectures
into
a
series
of
tales
was
a
cold
morning
of
the
early
spring
and
we
sat
after
breakfast
on
either
side
of
a
cheery
fire
in
the
old
room
at
a
thick
fog
rolled
down
between
the
lines
of
dun
coloured
houses
and
the
opposing
windows
loomed
like
dark
shapeless
blurs
through
the
heavy
yellow
wreaths
gas
was
lit
and
shone
on
the
white
cloth
and
glimmer
of
china
and
metal
for
the
table
had
not
been
cleared
yet
had
been
silent
all
the
morning
dipping
continuously
into
the
advertisement
columns
of
a
succession
of
papers
until
at
last
having
apparently
given
up
his
search
he
had
emerged
in
no
very
sweet
temper
to
lecture
me
upon
my
literary
shortcomings
the
same
time
he
remarked
after
a
pause
during
which
he
had
sat
puffing
at
his
long
pipe
and
gazing
down
into
the
fire
you
can
hardly
be
open
to
a
charge
of
sensationalism
for
out
of
these
cases
which
you
have
been
so
kind
as
to
interest
yourself
in
a
fair
proportion
do
not
treat
of
crime
in
its
legal
sense
at
all
small
matter
in
which
i
endeavoured
to
help
the
of
the
singular
experience
of
the
problem
connected
with
the
man
with
the
twisted
lip
and
the
incident
of
the
noble
bachelor
were
all
matters
which
are
outside
the
pale
of
the
law
in
avoiding
the
sensational
i
fear
that
you
may
have
bordered
on
the
trivial
end
may
have
been
so
i
answered
but
the
methods
i
hold
to
have
been
novel
and
of
interest
my
dear
fellow
what
do
the
public
the
great
unobservant
public
who
could
hardly
tell
a
weaver
by
his
tooth
or
a
compositor
by
his
left
thumb
care
about
the
finer
shades
of
analysis
and
deduction
indeed
if
you
are
trivial
i
cannot
blame
you
for
the
days
of
the
great
cases
are
past
or
at
least
criminal
man
has
lost
all
enterprise
and
originality
to
my
own
little
practice
it
seems
to
be
degenerating
into
an
agency
for
recovering
lost
lead
pencils
and
giving
advice
to
young
ladies
from
boarding
schools
i
think
that
i
have
touched
bottom
at
last
however
note
i
had
this
morning
marks
my
zero
point
i
fancy
it
tossed
a
crumpled
letter
across
to
me
was
dated
from
upon
the
preceding
evening
and
ran
thus
dear
mr
holmes
i
am
very
anxious
to
consult
you
as
to
whether
i
should
or
should
not
accept
a
situation
which
has
been
offered
to
me
as
governess
i
shall
call
at
half
past
ten
to
morrow
if
i
do
not
inconvenience
you
faithfully
violet
hunter
you
know
the
young
lady
i
asked
i
is
half
past
ten
now
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
is
her
ring
may
turn
out
to
be
of
more
interest
than
you
think
remember
that
the
affair
of
the
blue
carbuncle
which
appeared
to
be
a
mere
whim
at
first
developed
into
a
serious
investigation
may
be
so
in
this
case
also
let
us
hope
so
our
doubts
will
very
soon
be
solved
for
here
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
is
the
person
in
question
he
spoke
the
door
opened
and
a
young
lady
entered
the
room
was
plainly
but
neatly
dressed
with
a
bright
quick
face
freckled
like
a
plover
s
egg
and
with
the
brisk
manner
of
a
woman
who
has
had
her
own
way
to
make
in
the
world
will
excuse
my
troubling
you
i
am
sure
said
she
as
my
companion
rose
to
greet
her
but
i
have
had
a
very
strange
experience
and
as
i
have
no
parents
or
relations
of
any
sort
from
whom
i
could
ask
advice
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
what
i
should
do
take
a
seat
i
shall
be
happy
to
do
anything
that
i
can
to
serve
you
i
could
see
that
was
favourably
impressed
by
the
manner
and
speech
of
his
new
client
looked
her
over
in
his
searching
fashion
and
then
composed
himself
with
his
lids
drooping
and
his
finger
tips
together
to
listen
to
her
story
i
have
been
a
governess
for
five
years
said
she
in
the
family
of
but
two
months
ago
the
colonel
received
an
appointment
at
in
and
took
his
children
over
to
with
him
so
that
i
found
myself
without
a
situation
i
advertised
and
i
answered
advertisements
but
without
success
last
the
little
money
which
i
had
saved
began
to
run
short
and
i
was
at
my
wit
s
end
as
to
what
i
should
do
is
a
well
known
agency
for
governesses
in
the
called
s
and
there
i
used
to
call
about
once
a
week
in
order
to
see
whether
anything
had
turned
up
which
might
suit
me
was
the
name
of
the
founder
of
the
business
but
it
is
really
managed
by
sits
in
her
own
little
office
and
the
ladies
who
are
seeking
employment
wait
in
an
anteroom
and
are
then
shown
in
one
by
one
when
she
consults
her
ledgers
and
sees
whether
she
has
anything
which
would
suit
them
when
i
called
last
week
i
was
shown
into
the
little
office
as
usual
but
i
found
that
was
not
alone
a
prodigiously
stout
man
with
a
very
smiling
face
and
a
great
heavy
chin
which
rolled
down
in
fold
upon
fold
over
his
throat
sat
at
her
elbow
with
a
pair
of
glasses
on
his
nose
looking
very
earnestly
at
the
ladies
who
entered
i
came
in
he
gave
quite
a
jump
in
his
chair
and
turned
quickly
to
will
do
said
he
i
could
not
ask
for
anything
better
capital
seemed
quite
enthusiastic
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
in
the
most
genial
fashion
was
such
a
comfortable
looking
man
that
it
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
look
at
him
are
looking
for
a
situation
miss
he
asked
sir
governess
sir
what
salary
do
you
ask
i
had
pounds
a
month
in
my
last
place
with
tut
tut
sweating
rank
sweating
he
cried
throwing
his
fat
hands
out
into
the
air
like
a
man
who
is
in
a
boiling
passion
could
anyone
offer
so
pitiful
a
sum
to
a
lady
with
such
attractions
and
accomplishments
accomplishments
sir
may
be
less
than
you
imagine
said
i
a
little
a
little
music
and
drawing
tut
he
cried
is
all
quite
beside
the
question
point
is
have
you
or
have
you
not
the
bearing
and
deportment
of
a
lady
it
is
in
a
nutshell
you
have
not
you
are
not
fitted
for
the
rearing
of
a
child
who
may
some
day
play
a
considerable
part
in
the
history
of
the
country
if
you
have
why
then
how
could
any
gentleman
ask
you
to
condescend
to
accept
anything
under
the
three
figures
salary
with
me
madam
would
commence
at
pounds
a
year
may
imagine
that
to
me
destitute
as
i
was
such
an
offer
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true
gentleman
however
seeing
perhaps
the
look
of
incredulity
upon
my
face
opened
a
pocket
book
and
took
out
a
note
is
also
my
custom
said
he
smiling
in
the
most
pleasant
fashion
until
his
eyes
were
just
two
little
shining
slits
amid
the
white
creases
of
his
face
to
advance
to
my
young
ladies
half
their
salary
beforehand
so
that
they
may
meet
any
little
expenses
of
their
journey
and
their
wardrobe
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
never
met
so
fascinating
and
so
thoughtful
a
man
i
was
already
in
debt
to
my
tradesmen
the
advance
was
a
great
convenience
and
yet
there
was
something
unnatural
about
the
whole
transaction
which
made
me
wish
to
know
a
little
more
before
i
quite
committed
myself
i
ask
where
you
live
sir
said
i
rural
place
five
miles
on
the
far
side
of
is
the
most
lovely
country
my
dear
young
lady
and
the
dearest
old
country
house
my
duties
sir
i
should
be
glad
to
know
what
they
would
be
child
one
dear
little
romper
just
six
years
old
if
you
could
see
him
killing
cockroaches
with
a
slipper
smack
smack
gone
before
you
could
wink
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
his
eyes
into
his
head
again
i
was
a
little
startled
at
the
nature
of
the
child
s
amusement
but
the
father
s
laughter
made
me
think
that
perhaps
he
was
joking
sole
duties
then
i
asked
are
to
take
charge
of
a
single
child
no
not
the
sole
not
the
sole
my
dear
young
lady
he
cried
duty
would
be
as
i
am
sure
your
good
sense
would
suggest
to
obey
any
little
commands
my
wife
might
give
provided
always
that
they
were
such
commands
as
a
lady
might
with
propriety
obey
see
no
difficulty
heh
i
should
be
happy
to
make
myself
useful
so
dress
now
for
example
are
faddy
people
you
know
faddy
but
kind
hearted
you
were
asked
to
wear
any
dress
which
we
might
give
you
you
would
not
object
to
our
little
whim
said
i
considerably
astonished
at
his
words
to
sit
here
or
sit
there
that
would
not
be
offensive
to
you
no
to
cut
your
hair
quite
short
before
you
come
to
us
i
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
you
may
observe
my
hair
is
somewhat
luxuriant
and
of
a
rather
peculiar
tint
of
chestnut
has
been
considered
artistic
i
could
not
dream
of
sacrificing
it
in
this
offhand
fashion
i
am
afraid
that
that
is
quite
impossible
said
i
had
been
watching
me
eagerly
out
of
his
small
eyes
and
i
could
see
a
shadow
pass
over
his
face
as
i
spoke
i
am
afraid
that
it
is
quite
essential
said
he
is
a
little
fancy
of
my
wife
s
and
ladies
fancies
you
know
madam
ladies
fancies
must
be
consulted
so
you
won
t
cut
your
hair
sir
i
really
could
not
i
answered
firmly
very
well
then
that
quite
settles
the
matter
is
a
pity
because
in
other
respects
you
would
really
have
done
very
nicely
that
case
i
had
best
inspect
a
few
more
of
your
young
ladies
manageress
had
sat
all
this
while
busy
with
her
papers
without
a
word
to
either
of
us
but
she
glanced
at
me
now
with
so
much
annoyance
upon
her
face
that
i
could
not
help
suspecting
that
she
had
lost
a
handsome
commission
through
my
refusal
you
desire
your
name
to
be
kept
upon
the
books
she
asked
you
please
really
it
seems
rather
useless
since
you
refuse
the
most
excellent
offers
in
this
fashion
said
she
sharply
can
hardly
expect
us
to
exert
ourselves
to
find
another
such
opening
for
you
day
to
you
struck
a
gong
upon
the
table
and
i
was
shown
out
by
the
page
when
i
got
back
to
my
lodgings
and
found
little
enough
in
the
cupboard
and
two
or
three
bills
upon
the
table
i
began
to
ask
myself
whether
i
had
not
done
a
very
foolish
thing
all
if
these
people
had
strange
fads
and
expected
obedience
on
the
most
extraordinary
matters
they
were
at
least
ready
to
pay
for
their
eccentricity

day
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
and
by
the
day
after
i
was
sure
of
it
i
had
almost
overcome
my
pride
so
far
as
to
go
back
to
the
agency
and
inquire
whether
the
place
was
still
open
when
i
received
this
letter
from
the
gentleman
himself
i
have
it
here
and
i
will
read
it
to
you
near
dear
miss
hunter
has
very
kindly
given
me
your
address
and
i
write
from
here
to
ask
you
whether
you
have
reconsidered
your
decision
wife
is
very
anxious
that
you
should
come
for
she
has
been
much
attracted
by
my
description
of
you
are
willing
to
give
pounds
a
quarter
or
pounds
a
year
so
as
to
recompense
you
for
any
little
inconvenience
which
our
fads
may
cause
you
are
not
very
exacting
after
all
wife
is
fond
of
a
particular
shade
of
electric
blue
and
would
like
you
to
wear
such
a
dress
indoors
in
the
morning
need
not
however
go
to
the
expense
of
purchasing
one
as
we
have
one
belonging
to
my
dear
daughter
now
in
which
would
i
should
think
fit
you
very
well
as
to
sitting
here
or
there
or
amusing
yourself
in
any
manner
indicated
that
need
cause
you
no
inconvenience
regards
your
hair
it
is
no
doubt
a
pity
especially
as
i
could
not
help
remarking
its
beauty
during
our
short
interview
but
i
am
afraid
that
i
must
remain
firm
upon
this
point
and
i
only
hope
that
the
increased
salary
may
recompense
you
for
the
loss
duties
as
far
as
the
child
is
concerned
are
very
light
do
try
to
come
and
i
shall
meet
you
with
the

your
train
faithfully
jephro
rucastle
is
the
letter
which
i
have
just
received
and
my
mind
is
made
up
that
i
will
accept
it
i
thought
however
that
before
taking
the
final
step
i
should
like
to
submit
the
whole
matter
to
your
consideration
if
your
mind
is
made
up
that
settles
the
question
said
smiling
you
would
not
advise
me
to
refuse
i
confess
that
it
is
not
the
situation
which
i
should
like
to
see
a
sister
of
mine
apply
for
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
i
have
no
data
i
cannot
tell
you
have
yourself
formed
some
opinion
there
seems
to
me
to
be
only
one
possible
solution
seemed
to
be
a
very
kind
good
natured
man
it
not
possible
that
his
wife
is
a
lunatic
that
he
desires
to
keep
the
matter
quiet
for
fear
she
should
be
taken
to
an
asylum
and
that
he
humours
her
fancies
in
every
way
in
order
to
prevent
an
outbreak
is
a
possible
solution
in
fact
as
matters
stand
it
is
the
most
probable
one
in
any
case
it
does
not
seem
to
be
a
nice
household
for
a
young
lady
the
money
the
money
yes
of
course
the
pay
is
good
too
good
is
what
makes
me
uneasy
should
they
give
you
pounds
a
year
when
they
could
have
their
pick
for
pounds
must
be
some
strong
reason
behind
i
thought
that
if
i
told
you
the
circumstances
you
would
understand
afterwards
if
i
wanted
your
help
i
should
feel
so
much
stronger
if
i
felt
that
you
were
at
the
back
of
me
you
may
carry
that
feeling
away
with
you
i
assure
you
that
your
little
problem
promises
to
be
the
most
interesting
which
has
come
my
way
for
some
months
is
something
distinctly
novel
about
some
of
the
features
you
should
find
yourself
in
doubt
or
in
danger
danger
do
you
foresee
shook
his
head
gravely
would
cease
to
be
a
danger
if
we
could
define
it
said
he
at
any
time
day
or
night
a
telegram
would
bring
me
down
to
your
help
is
enough
rose
briskly
from
her
chair
with
the
anxiety
all
swept
from
her
face
i
shall
go
down
to
quite
easy
in
my
mind
now
i
shall
write
to
at
once
sacrifice
my
poor
hair
to
night
and
start
for
to
morrow
a
few
grateful
words
to
she
bade
us
both
good
night
and
bustled
off
upon
her
way
least
said
i
as
we
heard
her
quick
firm
steps
descending
the
stairs
she
seems
to
be
a
young
lady
who
is
very
well
able
to
take
care
of
herself
she
would
need
to
be
said
gravely
i
am
much
mistaken
if
we
do
not
hear
from
her
before
many
days
are
past
was
not
very
long
before
my
friend
s
prediction
was
fulfilled
a
fortnight
went
by
during
which
i
frequently
found
my
thoughts
turning
in
her
direction
and
wondering
what
strange
side
alley
of
human
experience
this
lonely
woman
had
strayed
into
unusual
salary
the
curious
conditions
the
light
duties
all
pointed
to
something
abnormal
though
whether
a
fad
or
a
plot
or
whether
the
man
were
a
philanthropist
or
a
villain
it
was
quite
beyond
my
powers
to
determine
to
i
observed
that
he
sat
frequently
for
half
an
hour
on
end
with
knitted
brows
and
an
abstracted
air
but
he
swept
the
matter
away
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
when
i
mentioned
it
data
data
he
cried
impatiently
i
can
t
make
bricks
without
clay
yet
he
would
always
wind
up
by
muttering
that
no
sister
of
his
should
ever
have
accepted
such
a
situation
telegram
which
we
eventually
received
came
late
one
night
just
as
i
was
thinking
of
turning
in
and
was
settling
down
to
one
of
those
all
night
chemical
researches
which
he
frequently
indulged
in
when
i
would
leave
him
stooping
over
a
retort
and
a
test
tube
at
night
and
find
him
in
the
same
position
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
opened
the
yellow
envelope
and
then
glancing
at
the
message
threw
it
across
to
me
look
up
the
trains
in
said
he
and
turned
back
to
his
chemical
studies
summons
was
a
brief
and
urgent
one
be
at
the
at
at
midday
to
morrow
it
said
come
i
am
at
my
wit
s
end
hunter
you
come
with
me
asked
glancing
up
i
should
wish
to
look
it
up
then
is
a
train
at
half
past
nine
said
i
glancing
over
my
is
due
at
at
will
do
very
nicely
perhaps
i
had
better
postpone
my
analysis
of
the
acetones
as
we
may
need
to
be
at
our
best
in
the
morning
eleven
o
clock
the
next
day
we
were
well
upon
our
way
to
the
old
capital
had
been
buried
in
the
morning
papers
all
the
way
down
but
after
we
had
passed
the
border
he
threw
them
down
and
began
to
admire
the
scenery
was
an
ideal
spring
day
a
light
blue
sky
flecked
with
little
fleecy
white
clouds
drifting
across
from
west
to
east
sun
was
shining
very
brightly
and
yet
there
was
an
exhilarating
nip
in
the
air
which
set
an
edge
to
a
man
s
energy
over
the
countryside
away
to
the
rolling
hills
around
the
little
red
and
grey
roofs
of
the
farm
steadings
peeped
out
from
amid
the
light
green
of
the
new
foliage
they
not
fresh
and
beautiful
i
cried
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
a
man
fresh
from
the
fogs
of
shook
his
head
gravely
you
know
said
he
that
it
is
one
of
the
curses
of
a
mind
with
a
turn
like
mine
that
i
must
look
at
everything
with
reference
to
my
own
special
subject
look
at
these
scattered
houses
and
you
are
impressed
by
their
beauty
i
look
at
them
and
the
only
thought
which
comes
to
me
is
a
feeling
of
their
isolation
and
of
the
impunity
with
which
crime
may
be
committed
there
heavens
i
cried
would
associate
crime
with
these
dear
old
homesteads
always
fill
me
with
a
certain
horror
is
my
belief
founded
upon
my
experience
that
the
lowest
and
vilest
alleys
in
do
not
present
a
more
dreadful
record
of
sin
than
does
the
smiling
and
beautiful
countryside
horrify
me
the
reason
is
very
obvious
pressure
of
public
opinion
can
do
in
the
town
what
the
law
cannot
accomplish
is
no
lane
so
vile
that
the
scream
of
a
tortured
child
or
the
thud
of
a
drunkard
s
blow
does
not
beget
sympathy
and
indignation
among
the
neighbours
and
then
the
whole
machinery
of
justice
is
ever
so
close
that
a
word
of
complaint
can
set
it
going
and
there
is
but
a
step
between
the
crime
and
the
dock
look
at
these
lonely
houses
each
in
its
own
fields
filled
for
the
most
part
with
poor
ignorant
folk
who
know
little
of
the
law
of
the
deeds
of
hellish
cruelty
the
hidden
wickedness
which
may
go
on
year
in
year
out
in
such
places
and
none
the
wiser
this
lady
who
appeals
to
us
for
help
gone
to
live
in
i
should
never
have
had
a
fear
for
her
is
the
five
miles
of
country
which
makes
the
danger
it
is
clear
that
she
is
not
personally
threatened
she
can
come
to
to
meet
us
she
can
get
away
so
has
her
freedom
can
be
the
matter
then
you
suggest
no
explanation
i
have
devised
seven
separate
explanations
each
of
which
would
cover
the
facts
as
far
as
we
know
them
which
of
these
is
correct
can
only
be
determined
by
the
fresh
information
which
we
shall
no
doubt
find
waiting
for
us
there
is
the
tower
of
the
cathedral
and
we
shall
soon
learn
all
that
has
to
tell
is
an
inn
of
repute
in
the
at
no
distance
from
the
station
and
there
we
found
the
young
lady
waiting
for
us
had
engaged
a
sitting
room
and
our
lunch
awaited
us
upon
the
table
i
am
so
delighted
that
you
have
come
she
said
earnestly
is
so
very
kind
of
you
both
but
indeed
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
do
advice
will
be
altogether
invaluable
to
me
tell
us
what
has
happened
to
you
i
will
do
so
and
i
must
be
quick
for
i
have
promised
to
be
back
before
three
i
got
his
leave
to
come
into
town
this
morning
though
he
little
knew
for
what
purpose
us
have
everything
in
its
due
order
thrust
his
long
thin
legs
out
towards
the
fire
and
composed
himself
to
listen
the
first
place
i
may
say
that
i
have
met
on
the
whole
with
no
actual
ill
treatment
from
and
is
only
fair
to
them
to
say
that
i
cannot
understand
them
and
i
am
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
them
can
you
not
understand
reasons
for
their
conduct
you
shall
have
it
all
just
as
it
occurred
i
came
down
met
me
here
and
drove
me
in
his
dog
cart
to
the
is
as
he
said
beautifully
situated
but
it
is
not
beautiful
in
itself
for
it
is
a
large
square
block
of
a
house
whitewashed
but
all
stained
and
streaked
with
damp
and
bad
weather
are
grounds
round
it
woods
on
three
sides
and
on
the
fourth
a
field
which
slopes
down
to
the
highroad
which
curves
past
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
front
door
ground
in
front
belongs
to
the
house
but
the
woods
all
round
are
part
of
s
preserves
a
clump
of
copper
beeches
immediately
in
front
of
the
hall
door
has
given
its
name
to
the
place
i
was
driven
over
by
my
employer
who
was
as
amiable
as
ever
and
was
introduced
by
him
that
evening
to
his
wife
and
the
child
was
no
truth
in
the
conjecture
which
seemed
to
us
to
be
probable
in
your
rooms
at
is
not
mad
i
found
her
to
be
a
silent
pale
faced
woman
much
younger
than
her
husband
not
more
than
thirty
i
should
think
while
he
can
hardly
be
less
than
forty
five
their
conversation
i
have
gathered
that
they
have
been
married
about
seven
years
that
he
was
a
widower
and
that
his
only
child
by
the
first
wife
was
the
daughter
who
has
gone
to
told
me
in
private
that
the
reason
why
she
had
left
them
was
that
she
had
an
unreasoning
aversion
to
her
stepmother
the
daughter
could
not
have
been
less
than
twenty
i
can
quite
imagine
that
her
position
must
have
been
uncomfortable
with
her
father
s
young
wife
seemed
to
me
to
be
colourless
in
mind
as
well
as
in
feature
impressed
me
neither
favourably
nor
the
reverse
was
a
nonentity
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
passionately
devoted
both
to
her
husband
and
to
her
little
son
light
grey
eyes
wandered
continually
from
one
to
the
other
noting
every
little
want
and
forestalling
it
if
possible
was
kind
to
her
also
in
his
bluff
boisterous
fashion
and
on
the
whole
they
seemed
to
be
a
happy
couple
yet
she
had
some
secret
sorrow
this
woman
would
often
be
lost
in
deep
thought
with
the
saddest
look
upon
her
face
than
once
i
have
surprised
her
in
tears
i
have
thought
sometimes
that
it
was
the
disposition
of
her
child
which
weighed
upon
her
mind
for
i
have
never
met
so
utterly
spoiled
and
so
ill
natured
a
little
creature
is
small
for
his
age
with
a
head
which
is
quite
disproportionately
large
whole
life
appears
to
be
spent
in
an
alternation
between
savage
fits
of
passion
and
gloomy
intervals
of
sulking
pain
to
any
creature
weaker
than
himself
seems
to
be
his
one
idea
of
amusement
and
he
shows
quite
remarkable
talent
in
planning
the
capture
of
mice
little
birds
and
insects
i
would
rather
not
talk
about
the
creature
and
indeed
he
has
little
to
do
with
my
story
i
am
glad
of
all
details
remarked
my
friend
whether
they
seem
to
you
to
be
relevant
or
not
i
shall
try
not
to
miss
anything
of
importance
one
unpleasant
thing
about
the
house
which
struck
me
at
once
was
the
appearance
and
conduct
of
the
servants
are
only
two
a
man
and
his
wife
for
that
is
his
name
is
a
rough
uncouth
man
with
grizzled
hair
and
whiskers
and
a
perpetual
smell
of
drink
since
i
have
been
with
them
he
has
been
quite
drunk
and
yet
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
it
wife
is
a
very
tall
and
strong
woman
with
a
sour
face
as
silent
as
and
much
less
amiable
are
a
most
unpleasant
couple
but
fortunately
i
spend
most
of
my
time
in
the
nursery
and
my
own
room
which
are
next
to
each
other
in
one
corner
of
the
building
two
days
after
my
arrival
at
the
my
life
was
very
quiet
on
the
third
came
down
just
after
breakfast
and
whispered
something
to
her
husband
yes
said
he
turning
to
me
we
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
falling
in
with
our
whims
so
far
as
to
cut
your
hair
i
assure
you
that
it
has
not
detracted
in
the
tiniest
iota
from
your
appearance
shall
now
see
how
the
electric
blue
dress
will
become
you
will
find
it
laid
out
upon
the
bed
in
your
room
and
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
put
it
on
we
should
both
be
extremely
obliged
dress
which
i
found
waiting
for
me
was
of
a
peculiar
shade
of
blue
was
of
excellent
material
a
sort
of
beige
but
it
bore
unmistakable
signs
of
having
been
worn
before
could
not
have
been
a
better
fit
if
i
had
been
measured
for
it
and
expressed
a
delight
at
the
look
of
it
which
seemed
quite
exaggerated
in
its
vehemence
were
waiting
for
me
in
the
drawing
room
which
is
a
very
large
room
stretching
along
the
entire
front
of
the
house
with
three
long
windows
reaching
down
to
the
floor
a
chair
had
been
placed
close
to
the
central
window
with
its
back
turned
towards
it
this
i
was
asked
to
sit
and
then
walking
up
and
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
began
to
tell
me
a
series
of
the
funniest
stories
that
i
have
ever
listened
to
cannot
imagine
how
comical
he
was
and
i
laughed
until
i
was
quite
weary
however
who
has
evidently
no
sense
of
humour
never
so
much
as
smiled
but
sat
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
a
sad
anxious
look
upon
her
face
an
hour
or
so
suddenly
remarked
that
it
was
time
to
commence
the
duties
of
the
day
and
that
i
might
change
my
dress
and
go
to
little
in
the
nursery
days
later
this
same
performance
was
gone
through
under
exactly
similar
circumstances
i
changed
my
dress
again
i
sat
in
the
window
and
again
i
laughed
very
heartily
at
the
funny
stories
of
which
my
employer
had
an
immense
r
pertoire
and
which
he
told
inimitably
he
handed
me
a
yellow
backed
novel
and
moving
my
chair
a
little
sideways
that
my
own
shadow
might
not
fall
upon
the
page
he
begged
me
to
read
aloud
to
him
i
read
for
about
ten
minutes
beginning
in
the
heart
of
a
chapter
and
then
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
he
ordered
me
to
cease
and
to
change
my
dress
can
easily
imagine
how
curious
i
became
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
this
extraordinary
performance
could
possibly
be
were
always
very
careful
i
observed
to
turn
my
face
away
from
the
window
so
that
i
became
consumed
with
the
desire
to
see
what
was
going
on
behind
my
back
first
it
seemed
to
be
impossible
but
i
soon
devised
a
means
hand
mirror
had
been
broken
so
a
happy
thought
seized
me
and
i
concealed
a
piece
of
the
glass
in
my
handkerchief
the
next
occasion
in
the
midst
of
my
laughter
i
put
my
handkerchief
up
to
my
eyes
and
was
able
with
a
little
management
to
see
all
that
there
was
behind
me
i
confess
that
i
was
disappointed
was
nothing
least
that
was
my
first
impression
the
second
glance
however
i
perceived
that
there
was
a
man
standing
in
the
a
small
bearded
man
in
a
grey
suit
who
seemed
to
be
looking
in
my
direction
road
is
an
important
highway
and
there
are
usually
people
there
man
however
was
leaning
against
the
railings
which
bordered
our
field
and
was
looking
earnestly
up
i
lowered
my
handkerchief
and
glanced
at
to
find
her
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
a
most
searching
gaze
said
nothing
but
i
am
convinced
that
she
had
divined
that
i
had
a
mirror
in
my
hand
and
had
seen
what
was
behind
me
rose
at
once
said
she
there
is
an
impertinent
fellow
upon
the
road
there
who
stares
up
at
friend
of
yours
he
asked
i
know
no
one
in
these
parts
me
very
impertinent
turn
round
and
motion
to
him
to
go
away
it
would
be
better
to
take
no
notice
no
we
should
have
him
loitering
here
always
turn
round
and
wave
him
away
like
that
i
did
as
i
was
told
and
at
the
same
instant
drew
down
the
blind
was
a
week
ago
and
from
that
time
i
have
not
sat
again
in
the
window
nor
have
i
worn
the
blue
dress
nor
seen
the
man
in
the
road
continue
said
narrative
promises
to
be
a
most
interesting
one
will
find
it
rather
disconnected
i
fear
and
there
may
prove
to
be
little
relation
between
the
different
incidents
of
which
i
speak
the
very
first
day
that
i
was
at
the
took
me
to
a
small
outhouse
which
stands
near
the
kitchen
door
we
approached
it
i
heard
the
sharp
rattling
of
a
chain
and
the
sound
as
of
a
large
animal
moving
about
in
here
said
showing
me
a
slit
between
two
planks
he
not
a
beauty
i
looked
through
and
was
conscious
of
two
glowing
eyes
and
of
a
vague
figure
huddled
up
in
the
darkness
t
be
frightened
said
my
employer
laughing
at
the
start
which
i
had
given
s
only
my
mastiff
i
call
him
mine
but
really
old
my
groom
is
the
only
man
who
can
do
anything
with
him
feed
him
once
a
day
and
not
too
much
then
so
that
he
is
always
as
keen
as
mustard
lets
him
loose
every
night
and
help
the
trespasser
whom
he
lays
his
fangs
upon
goodness
sake
don
t
you
ever
on
any
pretext
set
your
foot
over
the
threshold
at
night
for
it
s
as
much
as
your
life
is
worth
warning
was
no
idle
one
for
two
nights
later
i
happened
to
look
out
of
my
bedroom
window
about
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
and
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
was
silvered
over
and
almost
as
bright
as
day
i
was
standing
rapt
in
the
peaceful
beauty
of
the
scene
when
i
was
aware
that
something
was
moving
under
the
shadow
of
the
copper
beeches
it
emerged
into
the
moonshine
i
saw
what
it
was
was
a
giant
dog
as
large
as
a
calf
tawny
tinted
with
hanging
jowl
black
muzzle
and
huge
projecting
bones
walked
slowly
across
the
lawn
and
vanished
into
the
shadow
upon
the
other
side
dreadful
sentinel
sent
a
chill
to
my
heart
which
i
do
not
think
that
any
burglar
could
have
done
now
i
have
a
very
strange
experience
to
tell
you
i
had
as
you
know
cut
off
my
hair
in
and
i
had
placed
it
in
a
great
coil
at
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
evening
after
the
child
was
in
bed
i
began
to
amuse
myself
by
examining
the
furniture
of
my
room
and
by
rearranging
my
own
little
things
was
an
old
chest
of
drawers
in
the
room
the
two
upper
ones
empty
and
open
the
lower
one
locked
i
had
filled
the
first
two
with
my
linen
and
as
i
had
still
much
to
pack
away
i
was
naturally
annoyed
at
not
having
the
use
of
the
third
drawer
struck
me
that
it
might
have
been
fastened
by
a
mere
oversight
so
i
took
out
my
bunch
of
keys
and
tried
to
open
it
very
first
key
fitted
to
perfection
and
i
drew
the
drawer
open
was
only
one
thing
in
it
but
i
am
sure
that
you
would
never
guess
what
it
was
was
my
coil
of
hair
i
took
it
up
and
examined
it
was
of
the
same
peculiar
tint
and
the
same
thickness
then
the
impossibility
of
the
thing
obtruded
itself
upon
me
could
my
hair
have
been
locked
in
the
drawer
trembling
hands
i
undid
my
trunk
turned
out
the
contents
and
drew
from
the
bottom
my
own
hair
i
laid
the
two
tresses
together
and
i
assure
you
that
they
were
identical
it
not
extraordinary
as
i
would
i
could
make
nothing
at
all
of
what
it
meant
i
returned
the
strange
hair
to
the
drawer
and
i
said
nothing
of
the
matter
to
the
as
i
felt
that
i
had
put
myself
in
the
wrong
by
opening
a
drawer
which
they
had
locked
i
am
naturally
observant
as
you
may
have
remarked
and
i
soon
had
a
pretty
good
plan
of
the
whole
house
in
my
head
was
one
wing
however
which
appeared
not
to
be
inhabited
at
all
a
door
which
faced
that
which
led
into
the
quarters
of
the
opened
into
this
suite
but
it
was
invariably
locked
day
however
as
i
ascended
the
stair
i
met
coming
out
through
this
door
his
keys
in
his
hand
and
a
look
on
his
face
which
made
him
a
very
different
person
to
the
round
jovial
man
to
whom
i
was
accustomed
cheeks
were
red
his
brow
was
all
crinkled
with
anger
and
the
veins
stood
out
at
his
temples
with
passion
locked
the
door
and
hurried
past
me
without
a
word
or
a
look
aroused
my
curiosity
so
when
i
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
grounds
with
my
charge
i
strolled
round
to
the
side
from
which
i
could
see
the
windows
of
this
part
of
the
house
were
four
of
them
in
a
row
three
of
which
were
simply
dirty
while
the
fourth
was
shuttered
up
were
evidently
all
deserted
i
strolled
up
and
down
glancing
at
them
occasionally
came
out
to
me
looking
as
merry
and
jovial
as
ever
said
he
you
must
not
think
me
rude
if
i
passed
you
without
a
word
my
dear
young
lady
i
was
preoccupied
with
business
matters
i
assured
him
that
i
was
not
offended
the
way
said
i
you
seem
to
have
quite
a
suite
of
spare
rooms
up
there
and
one
of
them
has
the
shutters
up
looked
surprised
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
a
little
startled
at
my
remark
is
one
of
my
hobbies
said
he
i
have
made
my
dark
room
up
there
dear
me
what
an
observant
young
lady
we
have
come
upon
would
have
believed
it
would
have
ever
believed
it
spoke
in
a
jesting
tone
but
there
was
no
jest
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
me
i
read
suspicion
there
and
annoyance
but
no
jest
from
the
moment
that
i
understood
that
there
was
something
about
that
suite
of
rooms
which
i
was
not
to
know
i
was
all
on
fire
to
go
over
them
was
not
mere
curiosity
though
i
have
my
share
of
that
was
more
a
feeling
of
duty
a
feeling
that
some
good
might
come
from
my
penetrating
to
this
place
talk
of
woman
s
instinct
perhaps
it
was
woman
s
instinct
which
gave
me
that
feeling
any
rate
it
was
there
and
i
was
keenly
on
the
lookout
for
any
chance
to
pass
the
forbidden
door
was
only
yesterday
that
the
chance
came
i
may
tell
you
that
besides
both
and
his
wife
find
something
to
do
in
these
deserted
rooms
and
i
once
saw
him
carrying
a
large
black
linen
bag
with
him
through
the
door
he
has
been
drinking
hard
and
yesterday
evening
he
was
very
drunk
and
when
i
came
upstairs
there
was
the
key
in
the
door
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
he
had
left
it
there
and
were
both
downstairs
and
the
child
was
with
them
so
that
i
had
an
admirable
opportunity
i
turned
the
key
gently
in
the
lock
opened
the
door
and
slipped
through
was
a
little
passage
in
front
of
me
unpapered
and
uncarpeted
which
turned
at
a
right
angle
at
the
farther
end
this
corner
were
three
doors
in
a
line
the
first
and
third
of
which
were
open
each
led
into
an
empty
room
dusty
and
cheerless
with
two
windows
in
the
one
and
one
in
the
other
so
thick
with
dirt
that
the
evening
light
glimmered
dimly
through
them
centre
door
was
closed
and
across
the
outside
of
it
had
been
fastened
one
of
the
broad
bars
of
an
iron
bed
padlocked
at
one
end
to
a
ring
in
the
wall
and
fastened
at
the
other
with
stout
cord
door
itself
was
locked
as
well
and
the
key
was
not
there
barricaded
door
corresponded
clearly
with
the
shuttered
window
outside
and
yet
i
could
see
by
the
glimmer
from
beneath
it
that
the
room
was
not
in
darkness
there
was
a
skylight
which
let
in
light
from
above
i
stood
in
the
passage
gazing
at
the
sinister
door
and
wondering
what
secret
it
might
veil
i
suddenly
heard
the
sound
of
steps
within
the
room
and
saw
a
shadow
pass
backward
and
forward
against
the
little
slit
of
dim
light
which
shone
out
from
under
the
door
a
mad
unreasoning
terror
rose
up
in
me
at
the
sight
overstrung
nerves
failed
me
suddenly
and
i
turned
and
ran
ran
as
though
some
dreadful
hand
were
behind
me
clutching
at
the
skirt
of
my
dress
i
rushed
down
the
passage
through
the
door
and
straight
into
the
arms
of
who
was
waiting
outside
said
he
smiling
it
was
you
then
i
thought
that
it
must
be
when
i
saw
the
door
open
i
am
so
frightened
i
panted
dear
young
lady
my
dear
young
lady
you
cannot
think
how
caressing
and
soothing
his
manner
was
and
what
has
frightened
you
my
dear
young
lady
his
voice
was
just
a
little
too
coaxing
overdid
it
i
was
keenly
on
my
guard
against
him
i
was
foolish
enough
to
go
into
the
empty
wing
i
answered
it
is
so
lonely
and
eerie
in
this
dim
light
that
i
was
frightened
and
ran
out
again
it
is
so
dreadfully
still
in
there
that
said
he
looking
at
me
keenly
what
did
you
think
i
asked
do
you
think
that
i
lock
this
door
i
am
sure
that
i
do
not
know
is
to
keep
people
out
who
have
no
business
there
you
see
was
still
smiling
in
the
most
amiable
manner
i
am
sure
if
i
had
known
then
you
know
now
if
you
ever
put
your
foot
over
that
threshold
again
here
in
an
instant
the
smile
hardened
into
a
grin
of
rage
and
he
glared
down
at
me
with
the
face
of
a
demon
i
ll
throw
you
to
the
mastiff
i
was
so
terrified
that
i
do
not
know
what
i
did
i
suppose
that
i
must
have
rushed
past
him
into
my
room
i
remember
nothing
until
i
found
myself
lying
on
my
bed
trembling
all
over
i
thought
of
you
i
could
not
live
there
longer
without
some
advice
i
was
frightened
of
the
house
of
the
man
of
the
woman
of
the
servants
even
of
the
child
were
all
horrible
to
me
i
could
only
bring
you
down
all
would
be
well
course
i
might
have
fled
from
the
house
but
my
curiosity
was
almost
as
strong
as
my
fears
mind
was
soon
made
up
i
would
send
you
a
wire
i
put
on
my
hat
and
cloak
went
down
to
the
office
which
is
about
half
a
mile
from
the
house
and
then
returned
feeling
very
much
easier
a
horrible
doubt
came
into
my
mind
as
i
approached
the
door
lest
the
dog
might
be
loose
but
i
remembered
that
had
drunk
himself
into
a
state
of
insensibility
that
evening
and
i
knew
that
he
was
the
only
one
in
the
household
who
had
any
influence
with
the
savage
creature
or
who
would
venture
to
set
him
free
i
slipped
in
in
safety
and
lay
awake
half
the
night
in
my
joy
at
the
thought
of
seeing
you
i
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
leave
to
come
into
this
morning
but
i
must
be
back
before
three
o
clock
for
and
are
going
on
a
visit
and
will
be
away
all
the
evening
so
that
i
must
look
after
the
child
i
have
told
you
all
my
adventures
and
i
should
be
very
glad
if
you
could
tell
me
what
it
all
means
and
above
all
what
i
should
do
and
i
had
listened
spellbound
to
this
extraordinary
story
friend
rose
now
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
an
expression
of
the
most
profound
gravity
upon
his
face
still
drunk
he
asked
i
heard
his
wife
tell
that
she
could
do
nothing
with
him
is
well
the
go
out
to
night
there
a
cellar
with
a
good
strong
lock
the
wine
cellar
seem
to
me
to
have
acted
all
through
this
matter
like
a
very
brave
and
sensible
girl
you
think
that
you
could
perform
one
more
feat
i
should
not
ask
it
of
you
if
i
did
not
think
you
a
quite
exceptional
woman
i
will
try
is
it
shall
be
at
the
by
seven
o
clock
my
friend
and
i
will
be
gone
by
that
time
and
will
we
hope
be
incapable
only
remains
who
might
give
the
alarm
you
could
send
her
into
the
cellar
on
some
errand
and
then
turn
the
key
upon
her
you
would
facilitate
matters
immensely
i
will
do
it
shall
then
look
thoroughly
into
the
affair
course
there
is
only
one
feasible
explanation
have
been
brought
there
to
personate
someone
and
the
real
person
is
imprisoned
in
this
chamber
is
obvious
to
who
this
prisoner
is
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
the
daughter
if
i
remember
right
who
was
said
to
have
gone
to
were
chosen
doubtless
as
resembling
her
in
height
figure
and
the
colour
of
your
hair
had
been
cut
off
very
possibly
in
some
illness
through
which
she
has
passed
and
so
of
course
yours
had
to
be
sacrificed
also
a
curious
chance
you
came
upon
her
tresses
man
in
the
road
was
undoubtedly
some
friend
of
hers
possibly
her
fianc
and
no
doubt
as
you
wore
the
girl
s
dress
and
were
so
like
her
he
was
convinced
from
your
laughter
whenever
he
saw
you
and
afterwards
from
your
gesture
that
was
perfectly
happy
and
that
she
no
longer
desired
his
attentions
dog
is
let
loose
at
night
to
prevent
him
from
endeavouring
to
communicate
with
her
much
is
fairly
clear
most
serious
point
in
the
case
is
the
disposition
of
the
child
on
earth
has
that
to
do
with
it
i
ejaculated
dear
you
as
a
medical
man
are
continually
gaining
light
as
to
the
tendencies
of
a
child
by
the
study
of
the
parents
t
you
see
that
the
converse
is
equally
valid
i
have
frequently
gained
my
first
real
insight
into
the
character
of
parents
by
studying
their
children
child
s
disposition
is
abnormally
cruel
merely
for
cruelty
s
sake
and
whether
he
derives
this
from
his
smiling
father
as
i
should
suspect
or
from
his
mother
it
bodes
evil
for
the
poor
girl
who
is
in
their
power
i
am
sure
that
you
are
right
cried
our
client
a
thousand
things
come
back
to
me
which
make
me
certain
that
you
have
hit
it
let
us
lose
not
an
instant
in
bringing
help
to
this
poor
creature
must
be
circumspect
for
we
are
dealing
with
a
very
cunning
man
can
do
nothing
until
seven
o
clock
that
hour
we
shall
be
with
you
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
solve
the
mystery
were
as
good
as
our
word
for
it
was
just
seven
when
we
reached
the
having
put
up
our
trap
at
a
wayside
public
house
group
of
trees
with
their
dark
leaves
shining
like
burnished
metal
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
were
sufficient
to
mark
the
house
even
had
not
been
standing
smiling
on
the
door
step
you
managed
it
asked
a
loud
thudding
noise
came
from
somewhere
downstairs
is
in
the
cellar
said
she
husband
lies
snoring
on
the
kitchen
rug
are
his
keys
which
are
the
duplicates
of
s
have
done
well
indeed
cried
with
enthusiasm
lead
the
way
and
we
shall
soon
see
the
end
of
this
black
business
passed
up
the
stair
unlocked
the
door
followed
on
down
a
passage
and
found
ourselves
in
front
of
the
barricade
which
had
described
cut
the
cord
and
removed
the
transverse
bar
he
tried
the
various
keys
in
the
lock
but
without
success
sound
came
from
within
and
at
the
silence
face
clouded
over
i
trust
that
we
are
not
too
late
said
he
i
think
that
we
had
better
go
in
without
you
put
your
shoulder
to
it
and
we
shall
see
whether
we
cannot
make
our
way
in
was
an
old
rickety
door
and
gave
at
once
before
our
united
strength
we
rushed
into
the
room
was
empty
was
no
furniture
save
a
little
pallet
bed
a
small
table
and
a
basketful
of
linen
skylight
above
was
open
and
the
prisoner
gone
has
been
some
villainy
here
said
this
beauty
has
guessed
s
intentions
and
has
carried
his
victim
off
how
the
skylight
shall
soon
see
how
he
managed
it
swung
himself
up
onto
the
roof
yes
he
cried
here
s
the
end
of
a
long
light
ladder
against
the
eaves
is
how
he
did
it
it
is
impossible
said
the
ladder
was
not
there
when
the
went
away
has
come
back
and
done
it
i
tell
you
that
he
is
a
clever
and
dangerous
man
i
should
not
be
very
much
surprised
if
this
were
he
whose
step
i
hear
now
upon
the
stair
i
think
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
have
your
pistol
ready
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
before
a
man
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
room
a
very
fat
and
burly
man
with
a
heavy
stick
in
his
hand
screamed
and
shrunk
against
the
wall
at
the
sight
of
him
but
sprang
forward
and
confronted
him
villain
said
he
where
s
your
daughter
fat
man
cast
his
eyes
round
and
then
up
at
the
open
skylight
is
for
me
to
ask
you
that
he
shrieked
you
thieves
and
thieves
i
have
caught
you
have
i
are
in
my
power
i
ll
serve
you
turned
and
clattered
down
the
stairs
as
hard
as
he
could
go
s
gone
for
the
dog
cried
i
have
my
revolver
said
i
close
the
front
door
cried
and
we
all
rushed
down
the
stairs
together
had
hardly
reached
the
hall
when
we
heard
the
baying
of
a
hound
and
then
a
scream
of
agony
with
a
horrible
worrying
sound
which
it
was
dreadful
to
listen
to
elderly
man
with
a
red
face
and
shaking
limbs
came
staggering
out
at
a
side
door
he
cried
has
loosed
the
dog
s
not
been
fed
for
two
days
quick
or
it
ll
be
too
late
and
i
rushed
out
and
round
the
angle
of
the
house
with
hurrying
behind
us
was
the
huge
famished
brute
its
black
muzzle
buried
in
s
throat
while
he
writhed
and
screamed
upon
the
ground
up
i
blew
its
brains
out
and
it
fell
over
with
its
keen
white
teeth
still
meeting
in
the
great
creases
of
his
neck
much
labour
we
separated
them
and
carried
him
living
but
horribly
mangled
into
the
house
laid
him
upon
the
drawing
room
sofa
and
having
dispatched
the
sobered
to
bear
the
news
to
his
wife
i
did
what
i
could
to
relieve
his
pain
were
all
assembled
round
him
when
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
gaunt
woman
entered
the
room
cried
miss
let
me
out
when
he
came
back
before
he
went
up
to
you
miss
it
is
a
pity
you
didn
t
let
me
know
what
you
were
planning
for
i
would
have
told
you
that
your
pains
were
wasted
said
looking
keenly
at
her
is
clear
that
knows
more
about
this
matter
than
anyone
else
sir
i
do
and
i
am
ready
enough
to
tell
what
i
know
pray
sit
down
and
let
us
hear
it
for
there
are
several
points
on
which
i
must
confess
that
i
am
still
in
the
dark
i
will
soon
make
it
clear
to
you
said
she
and
i
d
have
done
so
before
now
if
i
could
ha
got
out
from
the
cellar
there
s
police
court
business
over
this
you
ll
remember
that
i
was
the
one
that
stood
your
friend
and
that
i
was
s
friend
too
was
never
happy
at
home
wasn
t
from
the
time
that
her
father
married
again
was
slighted
like
and
had
no
say
in
anything
but
it
never
really
became
bad
for
her
until
after
she
met
at
a
friend
s
house
well
as
i
could
learn
had
rights
of
her
own
by
will
but
she
was
so
quiet
and
patient
she
was
that
she
never
said
a
word
about
them
but
just
left
everything
in
s
hands
knew
he
was
safe
with
her
but
when
there
was
a
chance
of
a
husband
coming
forward
who
would
ask
for
all
that
the
law
would
give
him
then
her
father
thought
it
time
to
put
a
stop
on
it
wanted
her
to
sign
a
paper
so
that
whether
she
married
or
not
he
could
use
her
money
she
wouldn
t
do
it
he
kept
on
worrying
her
until
she
got
brain
fever
and
for
six
weeks
was
at
death
s
door
she
got
better
at
last
all
worn
to
a
shadow
and
with
her
beautiful
hair
cut
off
but
that
didn
t
make
no
change
in
her
young
man
and
he
stuck
to
her
as
true
as
man
could
be
said
i
think
that
what
you
have
been
good
enough
to
tell
us
makes
the
matter
fairly
clear
and
that
i
can
deduce
all
that
remains
then
i
presume
took
to
this
system
of
imprisonment
sir
brought
down
from
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
disagreeable
persistence
of
was
it
sir
being
a
persevering
man
as
a
good
seaman
should
be
blockaded
the
house
and
having
met
you
succeeded
by
certain
arguments
metallic
or
otherwise
in
convincing
you
that
your
interests
were
the
same
as
his
was
a
very
kind
spoken
free
handed
gentleman
said
serenely
in
this
way
he
managed
that
your
good
man
should
have
no
want
of
drink
and
that
a
ladder
should
be
ready
at
the
moment
when
your
master
had
gone
out
have
it
sir
just
as
it
happened
i
am
sure
we
owe
you
an
apology
said
for
you
have
certainly
cleared
up
everything
which
puzzled
us
here
comes
the
country
surgeon
and
so
i
think
that
we
had
best
escort
back
to
as
it
seems
to
me
that
our
locus
standi
now
is
rather
a
questionable
one
thus
was
solved
the
mystery
of
the
sinister
house
with
the
copper
beeches
in
front
of
the
door
survived
but
was
always
a
broken
man
kept
alive
solely
through
the
care
of
his
devoted
wife
still
live
with
their
old
servants
who
probably
know
so
much
of
s
past
life
that
he
finds
it
difficult
to
part
from
them
and
were
married
by
special
license
in
the
day
after
their
flight
and
he
is
now
the
holder
of
a
government
appointment
in
the
island
of
to
my
friend
rather
to
my
disappointment
manifested
no
further
interest
in
her
when
once
she
had
ceased
to
be
the
centre
of
one
of
his
problems
and
she
is
now
the
head
of
a
private
school
at
where
i
believe
that
she
has
met
with
considerable
success

the
of
